## Generator

The entire set of cursor rules is autogenerated by XML files in the project `generator`.
[All XML files](./generator/src/main/resources/) use one single XML Schema, [pml.xsd](./generator/src/main/resources/pml.xsd) and those XML documents are transformed into Markdown with frontmatter using a [Java class](./generator/src/main/java/info/jab/pml/CursorRulesGenerator.java) and an [XSL file](./generator/src/main/resources/cursor-rules.xsl) specialized in the Cursor rule format.

If you have the idea to contribute, review the whole process in detail:

```bash
cd generator
./mvnw clean verify # Pass tests
./mvnw clean install # Pass tests & copy new .md files into .cursor/rules (The way to promote changes)
```

When you feel confident with the process, fork the repository and try to create new XML documents. Models will help you because an XML file is more rigid than natural language and it has `a common vocabulary` to create prompts.

When you feel confident with the solution, send a PR.
