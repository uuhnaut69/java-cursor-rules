## Generator

The whole set of cursor rules are autogenerated by XML files in the project `generator`.
[All XML files](./generator/src/main/resources/) use one Single XML Schema, [pml.xsd](./generator/src/main/resources/pml.xsd) and those XML documents are Transformed into Markdown with Frontmatter using a [Java class](./generator/src/main/java/info/jab/pml/CursorRulesGenerator.java) and a [XSL file](./generator/src/main/resources/cursor-rules.xsl) specialized in the Cursor rule format.

If you have the idea to contribute review the whole process in detail:

```bash
cd generator
./mvnw clean verify # Pass tests
./mvnw clean install # Pass test & copy new .md files into ./cursor/rules (The way to promote changes)
```

When you feel confident with the process, fork the repository and try to create new XML documents, Models will help you because a XML file is more rigid that natural lenguage and it has `a common vocabulary` to create prompts.

When you feel confident with the solution, send a PR.
