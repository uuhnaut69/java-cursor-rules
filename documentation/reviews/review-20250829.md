## Comparison Overview

| Factors | Description | Cursor | JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA + Cursor CLI | JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA + Claude Code CLI | GitHub Copilot (Free tier) | JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA + JetBrains Junie |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Usability** | Ease of use and user interface design. | 🟢 Excellent (Drag and Drop) | 🟢 Good | 🟢 Good | 🟢 Excellent (Drag and Drop) | 🟢 Excellent (Drag and Drop) |
| **Response Speed** | Measures the capacity of the different tools to reply to users. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Slow (Connection issues with models, slow experience compared to other alternatives but shows progress from the previous Junie version) |
| **Reasoning** | Measures the level of reasoning in the different alternatives. | 🟢 Excellent (The environment generates todo lists to structure execution) | 🟢 Excellent (The environment generates todo lists to structure execution) | 🟢 Excellent (The environment generates todo lists to structure execution) | 🟡 Limited (Reasoning requires more analysis time) | 🟢 Excellent (The environment generates todo lists to structure execution) |
| **Model Support** | Available AI models and their capabilities. | 🟢 Multiple models | 🟢 Multiple models | 🟡 Claude 4 Sonnet | 🔴 Poor (In Free tier. Only Chat GPT 4.1 provides good answers) | 🟡 Limited options |
| **Expected behaviour** | Measures the capacity to return the expected behavior for interactive system prompts and non-interactive system prompts. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Good (CLI doesn't behave 100% the same as Cursor IDE. Example: 170-java-documentation) | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Good (Limited to few Java classes) | 🔴 Doesn't always show alternatives for decision-making (Limited to one unique Java class to receive stable results). Doesn't always find the right project to analyze in scenarios with repositories containing multiple projects organized in folders. Alternatives sometimes don't appear, or appear in an external document. Sometimes applies changes in Java classes not included in the context |
| **Context window** | Measures the capacity to add packages or large sets of folders. | 🟢 Multiple | 🟢 Multiple | 🟢 Multiple | 🟡 Few classes | 🟡 Few classes (Unnecessary "Scroll down" message appears when adding large documents) |
| **Terminal interaction** | Capacity to execute terminal commands described in system prompts. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🔴 Not always (Restrictions & safeguards are skipped) | 🟢 Excellent |
| **Understanding prompt parts** | Capacity to understand all parts of a prompt. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🔴  Not always (Restrictions & safeguards are skipped) | 🟢 Good support |
| **Rollback support** | Capacity to roll back to previous state after changes. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Not always | 🟡 Not always (Example: "Create a document with all cursor rules for Java using the cursor rule @100-java-cursor-rules-list" in scenarios involving tests) |
| **File system support** | Capacity to discover files added to context in relation to the physical file system. | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Not always | 🟡 Limited (It is more accurate to add files to the context, not the path) |
| **Works with Cursor rules for Java** | Measures the capacity to run this repository with different environments for Java development | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Very Good | 🟢 Excellent | 🟡 Limited | 🟡 Limited |

## Notes

- **Jetbrains Junie:** Huge evolution in a positive sense from *ej-eap-252.204.98*.
- **Cursor CLI:** Pretty interesting alternative with the new product Cursor CLI (cursor-agent) but the behavior is not 100% the same as Cursor IDE.
- **Github Copilot:** Tested only with capabilities from the free tier.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Cursor & JetBrains for the product support.
