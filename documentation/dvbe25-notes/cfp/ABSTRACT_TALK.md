Abstract

**The power of Cursor rules in Java Enterprise development**

Cursor AI is transforming software development for engineers and organizations alike. One of its most powerful features is Cursor Rules, which provide an intelligent way to leverage system prompts and enhance the developer experience when interacting with AI models during programming tasks. 

The talk will explain in detail the Cursor Rules feature and how it is useful for any Java Software engineer tackling issues in different areas such as build systems, design, coding, testing, code refactoring with modern Java features, and profiling to detect and resolve runtime issues like memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.

The talk will cover in detail:

- Conversational and non-conversational Cursor rules
- How to modularize Cursor rules
- How to chain Cursor rules

The session will demonstrate these concepts through practical examples using Spring Boot and Quarkus frameworks.
