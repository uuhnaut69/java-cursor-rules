Abstract

**The power of Cursor rules in Java Enterprise development**

System prompts are a very powerful feature that Cursor AI implemented and now more products are adopting like Claude Code, Github Copilot & Jetbrains Junie. The modern Software engineer can use in daily work or apply in data pipelines for automatic coding, code refactoring, continuous profiling, and other usecases.

The talk will explain in detail the concept and how it is useful for any Java Software engineer tackling issues in different areas.

The talk will cover in detail:

Fundamentals
How to apply with traditional IDEs
How to apply in Data Pipelines

The session will demonstrate these concepts through practical examples using Java
