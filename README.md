[![CI Builds](https://github.com/jabrena/cursor-rules-java/actions/workflows/maven.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jabrena/cursor-rules-java/actions/workflows/maven.yaml)

## Goal

The project provides a collection of `System prompts` for Java Enterprise development that help software engineers in their daily programming work and data pipelines.
The [available System prompts for Java](./CURSOR-RULES-JAVA.md) cover aspects like `Build system based on Maven`, `Design`, `Coding`, `Testing`, `Refactoring & JMH Benchmarking`, `Performance testing with JMeter`, `Profiling with Async profiler/OpenJDK tools`, `Documentation` & `Diagrams`.

### Compatibility with Modern IDEs, CLI & Others

The repository was designed to support Cursor, but other tools have evolved and now offer better support for system prompts. The repository runs regular regression tests for IDEs and tools such as *Cursor*, *Cursor CLI*, *Claude Code*, *GitHub Copilot*, and *JetBrains Junie*.

⚠️ **Note:** Currently, the best environments in which to use this repository are *Cursor*, *Cursor CLI*, and *Claude Code*. If you use *JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA*, you can combine it with *Cursor CLI* or *Claude Code*. Further information is available in the latest review [here](./documentation/reviews/review-20250829.md) (**Last update:** 2025/08/29).

## What is a System prompt?

A system prompt is a set of instructions given to an AI model that defines how it should behave, what role it should take on, and what guidelines it should follow when responding to users. Think of it as the "operating manual" that shapes the AI's personality, capabilities, and boundaries.

### Types of System prompts

The repository provides System prompts that can behave interactively or non-interactively, depending on how the user employs them.

- **System prompts:** `Create a UML class diagram with @170-java-documentation without asking questions` or `Add the Maven Enforcer plugin using the rule @112-java-maven-plugins without asking questions`
- **Interactive System Prompts:** Prompts that ask questions and include conditional logic. Examples: `Improve the pom.xml using the cursor rule @112-java-maven-plugins` or `Generate technical documentation and diagrams about the project with the cursor rule @170-java-documentation`

### Types of customized behaviours for system prompts

- **Consultative Interactive:** Prompts that suggest alternatives to improve software development. Examples: `Improve the class/classes added in the context applying the system prompt @128-java-generics with the behaviour @behaviour-consultative-interaction` or `Improve the class/classes added in the context applying the system prompt @131-java-unit-testing with the behaviour @behaviour-consultative-interaction`
- **Progressive Learning:** Using the system prompts, you can generate courses about a particular topic to better understand the changes generated by models. Example: `Create a course about @128-java-generics.md using the behavior @behaviour-progressive-learning.md and place the course in @courses`

### Java development workflow

Adding AI tools to the Java development workflow can increase the likelihood of implementing software specifications on time and with quality.

### Data pipelines workflow

Adding AI tools to your data pipeline can provide new opportunities to deliver more value (examples: automatic coding, code refactoring, continuous profiling, and others).

## Getting started

New to this repository? Start with our [comprehensive guide](./documentation/GETTING-STARTED.md) for a quick introduction to setting up and using the Cursor rules, then read about [how to integrate system prompts](./documentation/HOW-TO-USE.md) into your development workflow to maximize their effectiveness in your daily coding tasks. For a full understanding of this project, follow the course [Mastering System Prompts for Java](https://jabrena.github.io/cursor-rules-java/courses/system-prompts-java/index.html).

## How many system prompts for Java does this project include?

## Constraints, Output format & Safety guards

The cursor rules in this repository follow [The Three-Node Quality Framework for AI Prompts](https://jabrena.github.io/cursor-rules-java/blog/2025/prompt-quality-framework.html), which ensures both comprehensive responses and safe execution. This framework consists of three distinct pillars: **constraints**, **output-format** and **safeguards**. Each node operates at different phases of the AI interaction timeline, creating a defense-in-depth strategy.

The **constraints** act as gate-keeping mechanisms that define hard requirements and blocking conditions before any work begins - essentially asking "Can I start?" The **output-format** provides prescriptive guidance during execution, ensuring comprehensive coverage and organized responses by defining "What should I deliver?" Finally, **safeguards** implement protective measures throughout and after execution, continuously asking "Did it work safely?" This temporal flow from pre-execution validation to structured execution to continuous monitoring ensures quality at every stage.

This framework transforms AI from a general assistant into a specialized consultant with built-in quality controls and safety measures, making it particularly suitable for critical applications like Java software development. By embedding domain-specific expertise directly into the prompt structure, the cursor rules provide predictable, comprehensive, and safe interactions while reducing cognitive load for developers and ensuring system integrity throughout the development process.

## Limitations

### Lack of determinism

From the outset, be aware that the results provided by interactions with the different `Cursor rules` are not deterministic due to the nature of the models, but this can be mitigated with clear goals and validation checkpoints.

### Limits of interactions with models

Models are able to generate code, but they cannot run code with your local data. To address this limitation, some prompts provide scripts to bridge this gap on the model side.

## Java JEPS from Java 8

Java uses JEPs as the vehicle to describe new features to be added to the language. The repository continuously reviews which JEPs could improve any of the cursor rules present in this repository.
