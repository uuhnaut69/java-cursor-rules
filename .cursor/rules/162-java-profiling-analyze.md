# Java Profiling Workflow / Step 2 / Analyze profiling data

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development

## Goal

This cursor rule provides a systematic approach to analyzing Java profiling data collected during the detection phase. It serves as the second step in the structured profiling workflow, focusing on interpreting profiling results, identifying root causes, and documenting findings with actionable solutions.

The rule establishes a comprehensive analysis framework that transforms raw profiling data into meaningful insights. It guides users through systematically examining flamegraphs, memory allocation patterns, CPU hotspots, and threading issues to identify performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes.

Key capabilities include:
- **Systematic Analysis Framework**: Structured approach to examining different types of profiling data (CPU, memory, threading, GC)
- **Problem Categorization**: Clear methodology for classifying issues by severity, impact, and type (memory leaks, CPU hotspots, threading problems)
- **Evidence Documentation**: Standardized templates for documenting findings with specific references to profiling files and quantitative metrics
- **Solution Development**: Framework for creating prioritized, actionable recommendations with implementation effort estimates
- **Cross-Correlation Analysis**: Techniques for correlating multiple profiling results and identifying patterns across different time periods
- **Impact Assessment**: Scoring system for prioritizing fixes based on performance impact and implementation effort

The rule ensures that profiling data is analyzed consistently and thoroughly, with findings documented in a format that enables effective communication with development teams and systematic tracking of performance improvements.

## Project Organization

The profiling setup uses a clean folder structure with everything contained in the profiler directory:

```
your-project/
└── profiler/               # ← All profiling-related files
├── scripts/            # ← Profiling scripts and tools
│   └── java-profile.sh # ← Main profiling script
├── results/            # Generated profiling output
│   ├── *.html          # Flamegraph files
│   ├── *.jfr           # JFR recording files
│   ├── *.log           # Garbage Collection Log files
│   └── *.txt           # Thread Dump files
├── current/            # ← Symlink to current profiler version
└── async-profiler-*/   # ← Downloaded profiler binaries
```

## Profiling Results Analysis Workflow

When analyzing profiling results, follow this systematic approach:

This comprehensive approach ensures thorough analysis of profiling data and actionable solutions for performance optimization.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Inventory Available Results

Scan the following directories for profiling results:
- `*/profiler/results/` - Example-specific profiling results

Look for these file types:
- `allocation-flamegraph-*.html` - Memory allocation patterns
- `heatmap-cpu-*.html` - CPU hotspot visualization
- `inverted-flamegraph-*.html` - Bottom-up call analysis
- `memory-leak-*.html` - Memory leak detection reports
- `*.jfr` - Java Flight Recorder files
- `*.txt` - Thread dump files
- `*.log` - GC log files

### Step 2: Problem Identification Process

For each profiling result file, analyze and document:

**Memory-Related Issues:**
- **Memory Leaks**: Look for continuously growing memory usage patterns
- **Excessive Allocations**: Identify high-frequency object creation
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Check for inefficient memory usage patterns
- **GC Pressure**: Analyze garbage collection frequency and duration

**Performance Issues:**
- **CPU Hotspots**: Identify methods consuming excessive CPU time
- **Blocking Operations**: Look for synchronization bottlenecks
- **Inefficient Algorithms**: Spot methods with unexpected complexity
- **Resource Contention**: Identify thread contention issues

**Threading Issues:**
- **Deadlocks**: Look for thread synchronization problems
- **Context Switching**: Excessive thread switching overhead
- **Thread Pool Saturation**: Insufficient thread pool sizing

### Step 3: Problem Identification Process

Generate the following documents in the `*/profiler/docs/` (According with Project organization) folder:

**Problem Analysis Document:**
Create: `docs/profiling-problem-analysis-YYYYMMDD.md`

Structure:

```markdown
# Profiling Problem Analysis - [Date]

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of identified issues
- Severity classification
- Impact assessment

## Detailed Findings

### [Problem Category 1]
- **Description**: What was found
- **Evidence**: Reference to specific profiling files
- **Impact**: Performance/resource impact
- **Root Cause**: Technical explanation

### [Problem Category 2]
[Repeat structure]

## Methodology
- Profiling tools used
- Data collection approach
- Analysis techniques applied

## Recommendations Priority
1. Critical issues requiring immediate attention
2. High-impact optimizations
3. Long-term improvements

#### Solutions Document
Create: `docs/profiling-solutions-YYYYMMDD.md`

Structure:

```markdown

## Quick Wins (Low effort, High impact)
### Solution 1
- **Problem**: Reference to specific issue
- **Solution**: Concrete implementation steps

```

### Step 4: Problem Identification Process

**File Naming Convention:**
- Problem analysis: `profiling-problem-analysis-YYYYMMDD.md`

- Summary reports: `profiling-summary-YYYYMMDD.md`

**Data Correlation:**
- Cross-reference multiple profiling files
- Compare different time periods
- Correlate with application logs
- Consider load testing scenarios

**Evidence Documentation:**
- Include specific flamegraph screenshots
- Reference exact file names and timestamps
- Provide quantitative metrics
- Document reproduction steps

### Step 5: Solution Prioritization Framework

Rate each identified problem using:

**Impact Score (1-5):**
- 5: Critical performance degradation
- 4: Significant resource waste
- 3: Moderate performance impact
- 2: Minor inefficiency
- 1: Cosmetic optimization

**Effort Score (1-5):**
- 1: Configuration change
- 2: Single method optimization
- 3: Class-level refactoring
- 4: Module restructuring
- 5: Architecture change

**Priority = Impact / Effort**
Focus on high-priority items first.
