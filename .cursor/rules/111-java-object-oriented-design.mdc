# Java Object-Oriented Design Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for robust Java object-oriented design and refactoring. It emphasizes core principles like SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI, best practices for class and interface design including favoring composition over inheritance and designing for immutability. The rules also cover mastering encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and finally, identifying and refactoring common object-oriented design code smells such as God Classes, Feature Envy, and Data Clumps to promote maintainable, flexible, and understandable code.

## Implementing These Principles

These guidelines are built upon the following core principles:

1.  **Adherence to Fundamental Design Principles**: Embrace foundational principles like SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It). These principles are key to building systems that are robust, maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand.
2.  **Effective Class and Interface Design**: Employ best practices for designing classes and interfaces. This includes favoring composition over inheritance to achieve flexibility, programming to an interface rather than an implementation to promote loose coupling, keeping classes small and focused on a single responsibility, and designing for immutability where appropriate to enhance simplicity and thread-safety.
3.  **Mastery of Core OOP Concepts**: Thoroughly understand and correctly apply the pillars of object-oriented programming:
    *   **Encapsulation**: Protect internal state and expose behavior through well-defined interfaces.
    *   **Inheritance**: Model true "is-a" relationships, ensuring subclasses are substitutable for their base types (Liskov Substitution Principle).
    *   **Polymorphism**: Allow objects of different types to respond to the same message in their own way, simplifying client code.
4.  **Proactive Code Smell Management**: Develop the ability to identify common object-oriented design "code smells" (e.g., God Class, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Refused Bequest). Recognizing and refactoring these smells is crucial for improving the long-term health, maintainability, and clarity of the codebase.

- Rule 4: Identify and Refactor Object-Oriented Design Code Smells

## Rule 1: Adhere to Core Design Principles (SOLID, DRY, YAGNI)

Title: Apply Fundamental Software Design Principles
Description: Core principles like SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI are foundational to good object-oriented design, leading to more robust, maintainable, and understandable systems.

### Sub-Rule 1.1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Title: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
Description: This means a class should only have one job or primary responsibility. If a class handles multiple responsibilities, changes to one responsibility might inadvertently affect others.

**Good example:**
```java
// Good: Separate responsibilities
class UserData {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    // constructor, getters
    public UserData(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getEmail() { return email; }
}

class UserPersistence {
    public void saveUser(UserData user) {
        System.out.println("Saving user " + user.getName() + " to database.");
        // Database saving logic
    }
}

class UserEmailer {
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(UserData user) {
        System.out.println("Sending welcome email to " + user.getEmail());
        // Email sending logic
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: User class with multiple responsibilities
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public User(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getEmail() { return email; }

    public void saveToDatabase() {
        System.out.println("Saving user " + name + " to database.");
        // Database logic mixed in
    }

    public void sendWelcomeEmail() {
        System.out.println("Sending welcome email to " + email);
        // Email logic mixed in
    }
    // If email sending changes, or DB logic changes, this class needs to change.
}
```

### Sub-Rule 1.2: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Title: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Description: You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing, tested code. This is often achieved using interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism.

**Good example:**
```java
interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width, height;
    public Rectangle(double w, double h) { width=w; height=h; }
    @Override public double calculateArea() { return width * height; }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double r) { radius=r; }
    @Override public double calculateArea() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}

// New shapes (e.g., Triangle) can be added by implementing Shape
// without modifying existing Shape, Rectangle, Circle, or AreaCalculator.
class AreaCalculator {
    public double getTotalArea(List<Shape> shapes) {
        return shapes.stream().mapToDouble(Shape::calculateArea).sum();
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: AreaCalculator needs modification for new shapes
class AreaCalculatorBad {
    public double calculateRectangleArea(Rectangle rect) { return rect.width * rect.height; }
    public double calculateCircleArea(Circle circ) { return Math.PI * circ.radius * circ.radius; }
    // If a Triangle class is added, this class must be modified to add calculateTriangleArea().
}
class Rectangle { public double width, height; /* ... */ }
class Circle { public double radius; /* ... */ }
```

### Sub-Rule 1.3: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Title: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Description: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program or causing unexpected behavior.

**Good example:**
```java
interface Bird {
    void move();
}

class FlyingBird implements Bird {
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Flying high!"); }
    @Override public void move() { fly(); }
}

class Sparrow extends FlyingBird { /* Can fly */ }

class Ostrich implements Bird { // Ostrich is a Bird but doesn't fly in the typical sense
    public void runFast() { System.out.println("Running fast on the ground!"); }
    @Override public void move() { runFast(); }
}

public class BirdLSPExample {
    public static void makeBirdMove(Bird bird) {
        bird.move(); // Works correctly for Sparrow (flies) and Ostrich (runs)
    }
    public static void main(String args) {
        makeBirdMove(new Sparrow());
        makeBirdMove(new Ostrich());
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Violating LSP
class Bird {
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Bird is flying."); }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        // Penguins can't fly, so this method might do nothing or throw an exception.
        // This violates LSP because a Penguin can't simply replace a generic Bird where fly() is expected.
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly.");
    }
    public void swim() { System.out.println("Penguin is swimming."); }
}

public class BirdLSPViolation {
    public static void letTheBirdFly(Bird bird) {
        bird.fly(); // This will crash if bird is a Penguin
    }
    public static void main(String args) {
        try {
            letTheBirdFly(new Penguin());
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 1.4: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Title: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Description: It's better to have many small, specific interfaces (role interfaces) than one large, general-purpose interface. This prevents classes from having to implement methods they don't need.

**Good example:**
```java
// Good: Segregated interfaces
interface Worker {
    void work();
}

interface Eater {
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Worker, Eater {
    @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Human working."); }
    @Override public void eat() { System.out.println("Human eating."); }
}

class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Robot working efficiently."); }
    // RobotWorker does not need to implement eat()
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Fat interface
interface IWorkerAndEater {
    void work();
    void eat(); // All implementers must provide eat(), even if they don't eat.
}

class Human implements IWorkerAndEater {
    @Override public void work() { /* ... */ }
    @Override public void eat() { /* ... */ }
}

class Robot implements IWorkerAndEater {
    @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Robot working."); }
    @Override public void eat() { 
        // Robots don't eat. This method is forced and likely empty or throws exception.
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots don't eat."); 
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 1.5: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Title: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Description: Abstractions (e.g., interfaces) should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling.

**Good example:**
```java
// Abstraction
interface MessageSender {
    void sendMessage(String message);
}

// Low-level module (detail)
class EmailSender implements MessageSender {
    @Override public void sendMessage(String message) { System.out.println("Email sent: " + message); }
}

// Low-level module (detail)
class SMSSender implements MessageSender {
    @Override public void sendMessage(String message) { System.out.println("SMS sent: " + message); }
}

// High-level module
class NotificationService {
    private final MessageSender sender; // Depends on abstraction

    public NotificationService(MessageSender sender) { // Dependency injected
        this.sender = sender;
    }

    public void notify(String message) {
        sender.sendMessage(message);
    }
}

public class DIPExample {
    public static void main(String args) {
        NotificationService emailNotifier = new NotificationService(new EmailSender());
        emailNotifier.notify("Hello via Email!");
        
        NotificationService smsNotifier = new NotificationService(new SMSSender());
        smsNotifier.notify("Hello via SMS!");
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: High-level module depends directly on low-level module
class EmailerBad {
    public void sendEmail(String message) { System.out.println("Email sent: " + message); }
}

class NotificationServiceBad {
    private EmailerBad emailer; // Direct dependency on concrete EmailerBad

    public NotificationServiceBad() {
        this.emailer = new EmailerBad(); // Instantiates concrete class
    }

    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        emailer.sendEmail(message); // Tightly coupled
    }
    // If we want to use SMSSender, NotificationServiceBad needs to be changed.
}
```

### Sub-Rule 1.6: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Title: Avoid duplication of code.
Description: Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. Use methods, classes, inheritance, or composition to centralize and reuse code.

**Good example:**
```java
class CalculationUtils {
    // Centralized validation logic
    public static void validatePositive(double value, String name) {
        if (value <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(name + " must be positive.");
        }
    }
}

class RectangleArea {
    public double calculate(double width, double height) {
        CalculationUtils.validatePositive(width, "Width");
        CalculationUtils.validatePositive(height, "Height");
        return width * height;
    }
}

class CircleVolume {
    public double calculate(double radius, double height) {
        CalculationUtils.validatePositive(radius, "Radius");
        CalculationUtils.validatePositive(height, "Height");
        return Math.PI * radius * radius * height;
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Duplicated validation logic
class RectangleAreaBad {
    public double calculate(double width, double height) {
        if (width <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Width must be positive."); // Duplicated
        if (height <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Height must be positive."); // Duplicated
        return width * height;
    }
}

class CircleVolumeBad {
    public double calculate(double radius, double height) {
        if (radius <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Radius must be positive."); // Duplicated
        if (height <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Height must be positive."); // Duplicated
        return Math.PI * radius * radius * height;
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 1.7: YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
Title: Implement features only when you actually need them.
Description: Avoid implementing functionality based on speculation that it might be needed in the future. This helps prevent over-engineering and keeps the codebase simpler and more focused on current requirements.

**Good example:**
```java
// Good: Simple class meeting current needs
class ReportGenerator {
    public String generateSimpleReport(List<String> data) {
        System.out.println("Generating simple report.");
        return "Report: " + String.join(", ", data);
    }
    // If PDF export is needed later, it can be added then.
    // No need to implement generatePdfReport, generateExcelReport etc. upfront.
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Over-engineered with features not currently needed
class ReportGeneratorOverkill {
    public String generateHtmlReport(List<String> data) { /* ... */ return "html";}
    public byte generatePdfReport(List<String> data) { 
        System.out.println("Generating PDF report (not actually used yet).");
        return new byte0; 
    }
    public byte generateExcelReport(List<String> data) { 
        System.out.println("Generating Excel report (not actually used yet).");
        return new byte0;
    }
    // Current requirement is only for HTML, but PDF and Excel are added "just in case".
}
```

## Rule 2: Follow Best Practices for Class and Interface Design

Title: Design Well-Structured and Maintainable Classes and Interfaces
Description: Good class and interface design is crucial for building flexible and understandable OOD systems.
- **Favor Composition over Inheritance:** Where possible, use composition (has-a relationship) to reuse code and build complex objects by assembling smaller, focused objects. Inheritance (is-a relationship) can lead to tight coupling and fragile class hierarchies if overused or misused.
- **Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation:** Depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations. This promotes loose coupling and allows different implementations to be swapped easily.
- **Keep Classes Small and Focused:** Similar to SRP, ensure classes are not trying to do too much. Smaller classes are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Design for Immutability:** Immutable objects (whose state cannot change after creation) are simpler to reason about, inherently thread-safe, and can be freely shared without risk of unintended modification.
- **Clear Naming:** Use clear, descriptive, and unambiguous names for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables that accurately reveal their purpose and intent.

**Good example:**
(Illustrating composition and programming to an interface)
```java
// Interface (Abstraction)
interface Engine {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

// Concrete Implementations
class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    @Override public void start() { System.out.println("Petrol engine started."); }
    @Override public void stop() { System.out.println("Petrol engine stopped."); }
}

class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    @Override public void start() { System.out.println("Electric engine silently started."); }
    @Override public void stop() { System.out.println("Electric engine silently stopped."); }
}

// Class using Composition and Programming to an Interface
class Car {
    private final Engine engine; // Depends on Engine interface (abstraction)
    private final String modelName;

    // Engine is injected (composition)
    public Car(String modelName, Engine engine) {
        this.modelName = modelName;
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void startCar() {
        System.out.print(modelName + ": ");
        engine.start();
    }

    public void stopCar() {
        System.out.print(modelName + ": ");
        engine.stop();
    }
    
    public String getModelName(){ return modelName; }
}

public class ClassDesignExample {
    public static void main(String args) {
        Car petrolCar = new Car("SedanX", new PetrolEngine());
        Car electricCar = new Car("EVMax", new ElectricEngine());

        petrolCar.startCar();
        electricCar.startCar();
        petrolCar.stopCar();
        electricCar.stopCar();
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
(Illustrating tight coupling through concrete implementation and potentially problematic inheritance)
```java
// Bad: Tight coupling, not programming to an interface
class BadCar {
    private final BadPetrolEngine engine; // Direct dependency on concrete BadPetrolEngine
    public BadCar() {
        this.engine = new BadPetrolEngine(); // Instantiates concrete class
    }
    public void start() { engine.startPetrol(); }
    // If we want an electric car, this class needs significant changes or a new similar class.
}
class BadPetrolEngine { public void startPetrol() { System.out.println("Bad petrol engine starts."); } }

// Bad: Potentially misusing inheritance (Vehicle IS-A PetrolEngine? Not really)
/*
abstract class Vehicle {
    // ... common vehicle properties ...
}
class CarExtendsPetrolEngine extends BadPetrolEngine { // Car IS-A PetrolEngine? Incorrect modeling.
    public void drive() { System.out.println("Driving car that IS-A PetrolEngine."); }
}
*/
```

## Rule 3: Master Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

Title: Effectively Utilize Core Object-Oriented Concepts
Description: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism are the three pillars of object-oriented programming.

### Sub-Rule 3.1: Encapsulation
Title: Protect Internal State and Implementation Details
Description:
- Hide the internal state (fields) and implementation details of an object from the outside world.
- Expose a well-defined public interface (methods) for interacting with the object.
- Use access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `default/package-private`, `public`) effectively to control visibility and protect invariants.

**Good example:**
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Encapsulated: internal state is private
    private final String accountNumber;

    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        if (initialBalance < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial balance cannot be negative.");
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public interface to interact with the balance
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        this.balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount + ", New Balance: " + this.balance);
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        if (amount > this.balance) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds.");
        this.balance -= amount;
        System.out.println("Withdrew: " + amount + ", New Balance: " + this.balance);
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Controlled access to balance
        return this.balance;
    }
    public String getAccountNumber() { return this.accountNumber; }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Poor encapsulation, exposing internal state
class UnsafeBankAccount {
    public double balance; // Public field: internal state exposed and can be freely modified
    public String accountNumber;

    public UnsafeBankAccount(String accNum, double initial) { this.accountNumber = accNum; this.balance = initial; }
    // No methods to control how balance is changed, invariants can be broken.
}
public class BadEncapsulationExample {
    public static void main(String args) {
        UnsafeBankAccount account = new UnsafeBankAccount("123", 100.0);
        account.balance = -500.0; // Direct modification, potentially breaking business rules
        System.out.println("Unsafe balance: " + account.balance);
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 3.2: Inheritance
Title: Model "is-a" Relationships and Ensure LSP
Description:
- Use inheritance to model true "is-a" relationships, where a subclass is a more specific type of its superclass.
- Ensure that the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is followed: subclasses must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- Be cautious of deep or wide inheritance hierarchies, as they can become complex, hard to maintain, and may indicate a need for composition or different abstractions.

**Good example:**
(See LSP good example under Rule 1.3, or consider this Animal example)
```java
abstract class Animal {
    private String name;
    public Animal(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method for polymorphism
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Dog IS-A Animal
    public Dog(String name) { super(name); }
    @Override public void makeSound() { System.out.println(getName() + " says: Woof!"); }
    public void fetch() { System.out.println(getName() + " is fetching."); }
}

class Cat extends Animal { // Cat IS-A Animal
    public Cat(String name) { super(name); }
    @Override public void makeSound() { System.out.println(getName() + " says: Meow!"); }
    public void purr() { System.out.println(getName() + " is purring."); }
}

public class InheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
        Animal myCat = new Cat("Whiskers");
        myDog.makeSound();
        myCat.makeSound();
        // ((Dog)myDog).fetch(); // Can cast if sure of type to access specific methods
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
(See LSP bad example under Rule 1.3, or a fragile base class example)
```java
// Bad: Fragile base class or incorrect "is-a" relationship
class Window {
    public void open() { System.out.println("Window opened."); }
    public void close() { System.out.println("Window closed."); }
}

// class CarDoor extends Window { /* A CarDoor IS-A Window? Not really. It has a window, but isn't one itself.
// This leads to inheriting methods that might not make sense (e.g. a CarDoor might have a window that opens/closes,
// but the door itself doesn't open/close in the same way a house window does).
// This is better modeled with composition: CarDoor HAS-A WindowComponent. */
// }

class BetterCarDoor {
    private WindowComponent window = new WindowComponent();
    public void openDoor() { System.out.println("Car door opened."); }
    public void closeDoor() { System.out.println("Car door closed."); }
    public void openWindow() { window.open(); }
    public void closeWindow() { window.close(); }
    static class WindowComponent { /* Similar to Window */ 
        public void open() {System.out.println("Car window rolling down.");}
        public void close() {System.out.println("Car window rolling up.");}
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 3.3: Polymorphism
Title: Enable Objects to Respond to the Same Message Differently
Description:
- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes (that share a common superclass or interface) to respond to the same message (method call) in their own specific ways.
- It is primarily leveraged through inheritance (method overriding) and interfaces (implementing interface methods).
- Polymorphism simplifies client code, as it can interact with different types of objects through a common interface without needing to know their concrete types.

**Good example:**
```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class CircleShape implements Drawable {
    @Override public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing a Circle: O"); }
}

class SquareShape implements Drawable {
    @Override public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing a Square: "); }
}

class TriangleShape implements Drawable {
    @Override public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing a Triangle: /\\"); }
}

public class PolymorphismExample {
    public static void drawShapes(List<Drawable> shapes) {
        for (Drawable shape : shapes) {
            shape.draw(); // Polymorphic call: actual method executed depends on shape's concrete type
        }
    }
    public static void main(String args) {
        List<Drawable> myShapes = List.of(
            new CircleShape(), 
            new SquareShape(), 
            new TriangleShape()
        );
        drawShapes(myShapes);
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Lacking polymorphism, using type checking and casting
class ShapeDrawer {
    public void drawSpecificShape(Object shape) {
        if (shape instanceof CircleShapeBad) {
            ((CircleShapeBad) shape).drawCircle();
        } else if (shape instanceof SquareShapeBad) {
            ((SquareShapeBad) shape).drawSquare();
        } else if (shape instanceof TriangleShapeBad) {
            ((TriangleShapeBad) shape).drawTriangle();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unknown shape type.");
        }
        // This is not polymorphic. Adding new shapes requires modifying this method.
    }
}

class CircleShapeBad { public void drawCircle() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle (Bad)."); } }
class SquareShapeBad { public void drawSquare() { System.out.println("Drawing Square (Bad)."); } }
class TriangleShapeBad { public void drawTriangle() { System.out.println("Drawing Triangle (Bad)."); } }
```

## Rule 4: Identify and Refactor Object-Oriented Design Code Smells

Title: Recognize and Address Common OOD Code Smells
Description: Code smells are symptoms of potential underlying problems in the design. Recognizing and refactoring them can significantly improve code quality.

### Sub-Rule 4.1: Large Class / God Class
Title: A class that knows or does too much.
Description: Such classes violate SRP and are hard to understand, maintain, and test. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more focused classes.
**Good example:** (Separated responsibilities - see SRP Good Example)
**Bad Example:** (A single class doing parsing, validation, persistence, notification - see SRP Bad Example)

### Sub-Rule 4.2: Feature Envy
Title: A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually is in.
Description: This often means the method is using data from another class more than its own. Consider moving the method to the class it's "envious" of, or introduce a new class to mediate.

**Good example:**
```java
class Customer {
    private String name;
    private Address address;
    public Customer(String name, Address address) { this.name = name; this.address = address; }
    public String getFullAddressDetails() { // Method operates on its own Address object
        return address.getStreet() + ", " + address.getCity() + ", " + address.getZipCode();
    }
}
class Address {
    private String street, city, zipCode;
    public Address(String s, String c, String z) { street=s; city=c; zipCode=z; }
    public String getStreet() { return street; }
    public String getCity() { return city; }
    public String getZipCode() { return zipCode; }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
class Order {
    private double amount;
    private Customer customer; // Has a Customer
    public Order(double amount, Customer customer) { this.amount = amount; this.customer = customer; }

    // Bad: This method is more interested in Customer's Address than Order itself
    public String getCustomerShippingLabel() {
        Address addr = customer.getAddress(); // Assuming Customer has getAddress()
        return customer.getName() + "\n" + addr.getStreet() + 
               "\n" + addr.getCity() + ", " + addr.getZipCode();
        // Better: Move this logic to Customer class as getShippingLabel() or similar.
    }
}
// Assume Customer and Address classes from previous example
```

### Sub-Rule 4.3: Inappropriate Intimacy
Title: Classes that spend too much time delving into each other's private parts.
Description: This indicates tight coupling and poor encapsulation. Classes should interact through well-defined public interfaces, not by accessing internal implementation details of others.
**Good example:** (Classes interact via public methods - see Encapsulation Good Example)
**Bad Example:**
```java
class ServiceA {
    public int internalCounter = 0; // Public field, bad
    public void doSomething() { internalCounter++; }
}
class ServiceB {
    public void manipulateServiceA(ServiceA serviceA) {
        // Bad: Directly accessing and modifying internal state of ServiceA
        serviceA.internalCounter = 100; 
        System.out.println("ServiceA counter directly set to: " + serviceA.internalCounter);
        // Better: ServiceA should have a method like resetCounter(int value) if this is valid behavior.
    }
}
```

### Sub-Rule 4.4: Refused Bequest
Title: A subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents, or overrides them to do nothing or throw exceptions.
Description: This might indicate a violation of LSP or an incorrect inheritance hierarchy. The subclass might not truly be a substitutable type of the superclass.
**Good example:** (Subclass meaningfully uses/extends inherited features - see Inheritance Good Example or LSP Good Example for Ostrich)
**Bad Example:** (See LSP Bad Example with Penguin not being able to fly)

### Sub-Rule 4.5: Shotgun Surgery
Title: When a single conceptual change requires modifications in many different classes.
Description: This often indicates that a single responsibility has been spread too thinly across multiple classes, leading to high coupling and difficulty in making changes.
**Good example:** (A change in tax calculation logic only requires modification in a `TaxCalculator` class, not in `Order`, `Product`, `Invoice` classes that use it.)
**Bad Example:** (If changing a discount rule requires updates in `ProductPage`, `ShoppingCart`, `CheckoutService`, and `OrderConfirmationEmail` classes, it's shotgun surgery.)

### Sub-Rule 4.6: Data Clumps
Title: Bunches of data items that regularly appear together in multiple places (e.g., parameters in multiple methods, fields in several classes).
Description: These data clumps often represent a missing concept that should be encapsulated into its own object or record.

**Good example:**
```java
// Good: Encapsulating related data into a Range object
record DateRange(LocalDate start, LocalDate end) {
    public DateRange {
        if (start.isAfter(end)) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Start date must be before end date.");
    }
}

class EventScheduler {
    public void scheduleEvent(String eventName, DateRange range) {
        System.out.println("Scheduling " + eventName + " from " + range.start() + " to " + range.end());
    }
    public boolean isDateInRange(LocalDate date, DateRange range) {
        return !date.isBefore(range.start()) && !date.isAfter(range.end());
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```java
// Bad: Data clump (startDay, startMonth, startYear, endDay, endMonth, endYear) passed around
class EventSchedulerBad {
    public void scheduleEvent(String eventName, 
                              int startDay, int startMonth, int startYear, 
                              int endDay, int endMonth, int endYear) {
        // ... logic using these separate date parts ...
        System.out.println("Scheduling event with many date parameters.");
    }
    public boolean checkOverlap(int sDay1, int sMon1, int sYr1, int eDay1, int eMon1, int eYr1,
                              int sDay2, int sMon2, int sYr2, int eDay2, int eMon2, int eYr2) {
        // ... complex logic with many parameters ...
        return false;
    }
    // This pattern of passing around many related date parts is a data clump.
}
```
