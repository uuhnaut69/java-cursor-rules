# Spring Boot HikariCP Connection Pool Configuration

HikariCP is the default connection pool for Spring Boot and is known for being the fastest, most reliable connection pool available for Java applications. This guide will help you configure HikariCP optimally for your Spring Boot applications.

## Implementing These Principles

These guidelines are built upon the following core principles:

- **Performance First**: Configure pool sizes based on your application's actual database concurrency needs
- **Resource Efficiency**: Balance connection availability with memory and database server resources
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Enable metrics and logging to understand pool behavior
- **Environment-Specific**: Adjust configurations based on development, testing, and production environments
- **Fail-Fast**: Configure appropriate timeouts to detect issues quickly

## Rule 1: Essential Pool Sizing Configuration

**Title**: Right-size your connection pool based on application needs

**Description**: The most critical aspect of HikariCP configuration is determining the optimal pool size. Ask yourself: "How many concurrent database operations does my application actually need?" Most applications need far fewer connections than developers initially think.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- How many concurrent users will access my application?
- How many database operations happen per user request?
- What's my database server's connection limit?
- Am I running multiple application instances?

**Good example:**

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Start with this formula: connections = ((core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)
      # For most web apps: 10-15 connections is often sufficient
      maximum-pool-size: 10
      minimum-idle: 5
      # Allow pool to shrink during low activity
      idle-timeout: 300000  # 5 minutes
```

```java
// For programmatic configuration
@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig hikariConfig() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        // Conservative pool sizing for most applications
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(10);
        config.setMinimumIdle(5);
        config.setIdleTimeout(300_000);
        return config;
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# application.yml - DON'T DO THIS
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Too many connections - wastes resources and can overwhelm DB
      maximum-pool-size: 100
      minimum-idle: 50
      # Never let connections be idle - keeps unnecessary connections
      idle-timeout: 0
```

## Rule 2: Connection Timeout and Lifecycle Management

**Title**: Configure appropriate timeouts for reliable connection handling

**Description**: Proper timeout configuration ensures your application fails fast when database issues occur and doesn't hold onto stale connections. Ask yourself: "How long should my application wait for a database connection before giving up?"

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- What's an acceptable wait time for users when the database is under load?
- How quickly should I detect database connectivity issues?
- What's my application's typical query execution time?

**Good example:**

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Fast failure for connection acquisition
      connection-timeout: 20000      # 20 seconds - adjust based on your needs
      # Detect stale connections quickly
      max-lifetime: 1800000         # 30 minutes - less than DB connection timeout
      # Quick validation of connections
      validation-timeout: 5000       # 5 seconds
      # Test connections when borrowed from pool
      connection-test-query: SELECT 1
```

```java
// Programmatic configuration with monitoring
@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig hikariConfig() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setConnectionTimeout(20_000);
        config.setMaxLifetime(1_800_000);
        config.setValidationTimeout(5_000);
        
        // Enable connection testing
        config.setConnectionTestQuery("SELECT 1");
        return config;
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# application.yml - DON'T DO THIS
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Too long - users will think app is frozen
      connection-timeout: 120000
      # Too long - may exceed DB server timeout
      max-lifetime: 7200000
      # No validation - stale connections may be used
      # connection-test-query: # missing
```

## Rule 3: Health Check and Validation Configuration

**Title**: Implement robust connection health checking

**Description**: Configure HikariCP to validate connections and maintain pool health. Ask yourself: "How can I ensure my application always gets working database connections?"

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- Does my database server have connection timeouts?
- How can I detect network issues between app and database?
- Should I validate connections proactively or reactively?

**Good example:**

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Lightweight validation query for most databases
      connection-test-query: SELECT 1
      # Validate connections when borrowed (recommended for production)
      validation-timeout: 5000
      # Remove connections that fail validation
      leak-detection-threshold: 60000  # 60 seconds - helps find connection leaks
```

```java
// Database-specific configuration
@Configuration
@Profile("production")
public class ProductionDatabaseConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig hikariConfig() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        
        // PostgreSQL-specific validation
        config.setConnectionTestQuery("SELECT 1");
        config.setValidationTimeout(5_000);
        config.setLeakDetectionThreshold(60_000);
        
        // Additional PostgreSQL optimizations
        config.addDataSourceProperty("socketTimeout", "30");
        config.addDataSourceProperty("loginTimeout", "10");
        
        return config;
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# application.yml - DON'T DO THIS
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Heavy validation query that impacts performance
      connection-test-query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table WHERE complex_condition = 'value'"
      # No leak detection - memory leaks may go unnoticed
      # leak-detection-threshold: # missing
```

## Rule 4: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**Title**: Enable comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection

**Description**: Configure HikariCP to provide visibility into connection pool behavior. Ask yourself: "How will I know if my connection pool is properly sized and performing well?"

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- How can I monitor pool utilization in production?
- What metrics indicate pool sizing issues?
- How do I correlate application performance with database connection patterns?

**Good example:**

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # Enable detailed metrics
      register-mbeans: true
      pool-name: "HikariPool-${spring.application.name}"
      
# Enable JMX metrics for monitoring tools
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,metrics,hikari
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
```

```java
// Comprehensive monitoring setup
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "management.metrics.enabled", matchIfMissing = true)
public class DatabaseMonitoringConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig hikariConfig(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        
        // Enable metrics collection
        config.setRegisterMbeans(true);
        config.setPoolName("HikariPool-" + getApplicationName());
        config.setMetricRegistry(meterRegistry);
        
        // Configure alerts for pool exhaustion
        config.setConnectionTimeout(20_000);
        config.setLeakDetectionThreshold(60_000);
        
        return config;
    }
    
    private String getApplicationName() {
        return System.getProperty("spring.application.name", "app");
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# application.yml - DON'T DO THIS
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      # No monitoring enabled - flying blind in production
      register-mbeans: false
      # Generic pool name - hard to identify in monitoring tools
      pool-name: "pool"
```

## Rule 5: Environment-Specific Configuration Strategies

**Title**: Adapt HikariCP configuration for different environments

**Description**: Configure HikariCP differently for development, testing, and production environments. Ask yourself: "What are the different requirements for each environment where my application runs?"

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- How do my development and production database loads differ?
- Should I use different pool sizes for testing vs production?
- How can I make troubleshooting easier in development?

**Good example:**

```yaml
# application-dev.yml - Development environment
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 5          # Smaller pool for dev
      minimum-idle: 2
      connection-timeout: 30000     # Longer timeout for debugging
      leak-detection-threshold: 30000  # Faster leak detection for dev
      register-mbeans: true         # Enable for local monitoring

# application-prod.yml - Production environment  
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 20         # Larger pool for production load
      minimum-idle: 10
      connection-timeout: 20000     # Fast failure in production
      idle-timeout: 300000          # Allow shrinking during low load
      max-lifetime: 1800000         # Refresh connections regularly
      leak-detection-threshold: 60000
      register-mbeans: true
      pool-name: "${spring.application.name}-prod"
```

```java
// Environment-specific configuration
@Configuration
public class EnvironmentSpecificDatabaseConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @Profile("development")
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig devHikariConfig() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        // Development: Favor debugging over performance
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(5);
        config.setConnectionTimeout(30_000);
        config.setLeakDetectionThreshold(30_000);
        config.setRegisterMbeans(true);
        return config;
    }
    
    @Bean
    @Profile("production")
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariConfig prodHikariConfig() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        // Production: Favor performance and reliability
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(20);
        config.setMinimumIdle(10);
        config.setConnectionTimeout(20_000);
        config.setIdleTimeout(300_000);
        config.setMaxLifetime(1_800_000);
        config.setLeakDetectionThreshold(60_000);
        config.setRegisterMbeans(true);
        config.setPoolName(getApplicationName() + "-prod");
        return config;
    }
    
    private String getApplicationName() {
        return System.getProperty("spring.application.name", "app");
    }
}
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
# Same configuration for all environments - DON'T DO THIS
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 50        # Too many for dev, maybe wrong for prod
      minimum-idle: 25             # Wastes resources in all environments
      connection-timeout: 60000    # Too slow for production
      # No environment-specific tuning
```

## Quick Configuration Checklist

Before deploying your HikariCP configuration, ask yourself these questions:

1. **Pool Sizing**: Have I calculated the right pool size based on my application's concurrency needs?
2. **Timeouts**: Are my timeouts appropriate for fast failure detection without being too aggressive?
3. **Monitoring**: Can I see pool utilization and performance metrics in my monitoring system?
4. **Environment Differences**: Do I have different configurations for dev, test, and production?
5. **Database Specifics**: Have I configured database-specific optimizations?
6. **Connection Health**: Am I validating connections appropriately without impacting performance?
7. **Resource Limits**: Are my pool settings within my database server's connection limits?

Remember: Start with conservative settings and adjust based on monitoring data from your actual production load!
