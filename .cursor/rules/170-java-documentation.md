# Java Documentation Generator with modular step-based configuration

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development and technical documentation

## Goal

This rule provides a modular, step-based approach to generating comprehensive Java project documentation
including README.md files, package-info.java files, Javadoc, UML sequence diagrams, UML class diagrams, and C4 model diagrams.
Each step has a single responsibility and clear dependencies on user answers, making the documentation process more maintainable and user-friendly.

## Constraints

Before applying documentation generation, ensure the project is in a valid state by running Maven validation. This helps identify any existing issues that need to be resolved first.

- **MANDATORY**: Run `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before applying any documentation generation
- **VERIFY**: Ensure all validation errors are resolved before proceeding with documentation generation
- **PREREQUISITE**: Project must compile and pass basic validation checks before documentation
- **CRITICAL SAFETY**: If validation fails, IMMEDIATELY STOP and DO NOT CONTINUE with any documentation steps. Ask the user to fix ALL validation errors first before proceeding
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Never proceed to Step 1 or any subsequent steps if `mvn validate` or `./mvnw validate` command fails or returns errors

## Instructions

### Step 1: Documentation & Diagrams Preferences Assessment

**IMPORTANT**: Ask these questions to understand the documentation requirements before generating any documentation. Based on the answers, you will conditionally execute only relevant subsequent steps.

```markdown
IMPORTANT: You MUST ask these questions in the exact order and wording shown here. The very first question to the user MUST be "Question 1: What do you want to generate?". Do not ask any other questions prior to it.

Scope Selection

Conditional Flow Rules:
- Based on your selection here, only the relevant path(s) will be asked.
- If you choose "Documentation only", all diagram questions will be skipped.
- If you choose "Diagrams only", all documentation questions will be skipped.
- If you choose "Both", both paths will be asked in order: Documentation first, then Diagrams.

---

**Question 1**: What do you want to generate?

Options:
- Documentation only (README.md, package-info.java, Javadoc)
- Diagrams only (UML Sequence/Class/State-machine, C4)
- Both Documentation and Diagrams
- Skip

---

Documentation Path (README.md & package-info.java & Javadoc)

Conditional Flow Rules:
- Ask Documentation Path questions only if you selected "Documentation only" or "Both Documentation and Diagrams" in Question 1.
- If a question is not applicable due to a prior "Skip" in this path, do not ask it and continue to the Diagrams Path (if selected).

---

**Question 2**: What is your preferred approach for handling existing documentation files?

Options:
- Overwrite existing files (replace content completely)
- Add new information (merge with existing content intelligently)
- Create backup before modifying (save original as .backup)
- Skip files that already exist

---

**Question 3**: Which documentation files would you like to generate or update?

Options:
- README.md (project overview and usage instructions)
- package-info.java files (package-level documentation)

Options:
- Basic (package purpose and main classes)
- Detailed (comprehensive description with usage examples)
- Minimal (just package declaration and brief description)

---

**Question 6**: Should the documentation include code examples and usage patterns?
Ask this question only if you did not select "Skip" in Question 3.

Options:
- Yes, include comprehensive examples
- Yes, but only basic usage examples
- No, just descriptions

---

**Question 7**: What documentation style do you prefer?
Ask this question only if you did not select "Skip" in Question 3.

Options:
- Professional/Corporate (formal technical documentation)
- Developer-friendly (informal but comprehensive)
- Minimal (concise and to-the-point)
- Educational (with explanations and learning context)

---

**Question 8**: Would you like to enhance Java source files with Javadoc comments?

Options:
- Yes, add or improve Javadoc on public classes and methods
- Yes, but only for public APIs (exported/public packages)
- No, skip Javadoc source enhancement

---

**Question 9**: Would you like to generate Javadoc site documentation?
Ask this question only if you selected "Javadoc site documentation" in Question 3.

Options:
- Yes, generate Javadoc (mvn javadoc:javadoc)
- Yes, generate Javadoc and include in Maven Site (mvn clean site)
- No, skip Javadoc site generation

---

Diagrams Path

Conditional Flow Rules:
- Ask Diagrams Path questions only if you selected "Diagrams only" or "Both Documentation and Diagrams" in Question 1.

---

**Question 11**: For UML state-machine diagrams, which types would you like to generate?
Ask this question only if you selected "UML state-machine diagrams" or "All diagrams" in Question 10.

Options:
- Entity lifecycles (domain object state transitions like Order, User, Document)
- Business workflows (process state machines like approval, payment, shipping)
- System behaviors (component operational states like connections, jobs, transactions)
- User interactions (UI component state transitions like forms, wizards, dialogs)
- All state machine types
- Skip

---

```

#### Step Constraints

- **GLOBAL ORDERING**: The first user-facing question in this rule MUST be the template's "Question 1: What do you want to generate?" asked at the start of Step 1
- **DEPENDENCIES**: None
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask the exact questions from the template in strict order within each path (Documentation first, then Diagrams)
- **MUST** read template files fresh using file_search and read_file tools before asking questions
- **MUST NOT** use cached or remembered questions from previous interactions
- **MUST** ask questions ONE BY ONE in the exact order specified in the template
- **MUST** WAIT for user response to each question before proceeding to the next
- **MUST** use the EXACT wording from the template questions
- **MUST** present the EXACT options listed in the template
- **MUST NOT** ask all questions simultaneously
- **MUST NOT** assume answers or provide defaults
- **MUST NOT** skip questions or change their order, except when a question becomes inapplicable due to a prior "Skip" selection in the same path
- **MUST** confirm understanding of user selections before proceeding to Step 2
- **GUARD**: If any non-template question was asked earlier by mistake, RESTART the question flow from "Question 1" and ignore prior answers

### Step 2: README.md Generation

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive README.md files based on project structure and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected README.md generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "README.md", "Both README.md and package-info.java files", or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

Use the following template and guidelines:

# Java Documentation Implementation Guide

## README.md Generation

### Single Module Project

For single module projects, generate a comprehensive README.md in the project root with the following structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Software Description

[Analyze the entire src/main/java directory and provide a comprehensive description of the software, including:
- Main purpose and functionality
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Architecture patterns used
- Dependencies and integrations
- Entry points (main classes, controllers, etc.)]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java [version]
- Maven [version]

```

### Multi-Module Project

For multi-module Maven projects:

1. **Root README.md**: Overview of the entire project with links to module-specific documentation
2. **Module-specific README.md**: Each module gets its own README.md with detailed information about that module

#### Root README.md Structure:
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Software Description

[High-level project overview and architecture]

## Modules

- **[module-1]**: [Brief description] ([link to module README](module-1/README.md))
- **[module-2]**: [Brief description] ([link to module README](module-2/README.md))

[Rest of common sections...]
```

#### Module README.md Structure:
```markdown
# [Module Name]

## Software Description

[Detailed analysis of this specific module, including:
- Module's purpose within the larger project
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Module-specific dependencies
- Integration points with other modules]

[Module-specific getting started, configuration, etc.]
```

## package-info.java Generation

For each package found in src/main/java, generate or update package-info.java files:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Brief description of package purpose]
 *
 * This package contains [main functionality description].
 * Key classes: [list main classes with brief descriptions]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Comprehensive description]
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * [Detailed explanation of what this package does]
 *
 * <h2>Main Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ClassName1} - [Description and purpose]</li>
 * <li>{@link ClassName2} - [Description and purpose]</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * [Description of external dependencies this package uses]
 *
 * @since [version]
 * @author [author info if available]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief one-line description of package purpose].
 */
package [package.name];
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Use codebase_search to understand project structure, main classes, and functionality
2. **File Detection**: Check for existing README.md and package-info.java files
3. **Content Generation**: Based on analysis, generate appropriate documentation
4. **Merge Strategy**: If files exist, follow user preference for handling (overwrite/merge/backup)
5. **Validation**: Ensure generated documentation is accurate and helpful

## File Handling Options

### Overwrite
- Replace existing file content completely
- Create backup with .backup extension before overwriting

### Add New Information
- Parse existing README.md to identify existing sections
- Add missing sections without duplicating existing content
- For package-info.java, enhance existing documentation if present

### Create Backup
- Always create [filename].backup before making changes
- Useful for preserving original content while updating

### Skip Existing
- Only create documentation for files that don't already exist
- Safe option to avoid modifying existing documentation


## Single Module Project Implementation

# UML Sequence Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate UML sequence diagrams using PlantUML syntax to illustrate key application workflows and interactions.

### Analysis Process

**For each workflow identified:**

1. **Identify main actors and components**:
- External actors (users, systems, APIs)
- Internal components (controllers, services, repositories)
- Key domain objects and entities

2. **Trace interaction flows**:
- Method calls and message passing
- Conditional logic and alternative flows
- Loop and iteration patterns
- Error handling and exception flows

3. **Determine diagram scope** based on user selection:
- **Main application flows**: Authentication, core business processes
- **API interactions**: REST endpoint flows, request/response patterns
- **Complex business logic**: Multi-step processes, workflow orchestration

### Diagram Generation Guidelines

#### Basic Sequence Diagram Structure
```plantuml
@startuml
actor Actor
participant Controller
participant Service
participant Repository

Actor -> Controller: HTTP Request
Controller -> Service: Business Logic Call
Service -> Repository: Data Access
Repository --> Service: Data Response
Service --> Controller: Business Result
Controller --> Actor: HTTP Response
@enduml
```

#### Advanced Patterns

**Alternative Flows (Authentication Example)**:
```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant AuthController
participant AuthService
participant Database

User -> AuthController: POST /login
AuthController -> AuthService: authenticate(credentials)
AuthService -> Database: findUserByEmail(email)

alt User exists and password valid
Database --> AuthService: User data
AuthService -> AuthService: validatePassword()
AuthService --> AuthController: JWT token
AuthController --> User: 200 OK + token
else Authentication failed
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthenticationException
AuthController --> User: 401 Unauthorized
end
@enduml
```

**Loop Patterns (Batch Processing Example)**:
```plantuml
@startuml
participant Client
participant BatchService
participant ItemProcessor
participant Database

Client -> BatchService: processBatch(items)

loop For each item
BatchService -> ItemProcessor: processItem(item)
ItemProcessor -> Database: save(processedItem)
Database --> ItemProcessor: confirmation
ItemProcessor --> BatchService: result
end

BatchService --> Client: BatchResult
@enduml
```

**Advanced PlantUML Features**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Authentication and Authorization Flow

actor User
participant "Web Controller" as Controller
participant "Auth Service" as AuthService
participant "JWT Service" as JwtService
participant Database
participant "Cache" as Redis

== Authentication Phase ==
User -> Controller: POST /api/login
activate Controller
Controller -> AuthService: authenticate(credentials)
activate AuthService

AuthService -> Database: findUser(username)
activate Database
Database --> AuthService: UserEntity
deactivate Database

alt credentials valid
AuthService -> JwtService: generateToken(user)
activate JwtService
JwtService --> AuthService: JWT Token
deactivate JwtService

AuthService -> Redis: cacheUserSession(userId, token)
activate Redis
Redis --> AuthService: OK
deactivate Redis

AuthService --> Controller: AuthResponse(token)
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: 200 OK + JWT
deactivate Controller
else invalid credentials
AuthService --> Controller: UnauthorizedException
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: 401 Unauthorized
deactivate Controller
end

== Authorization Phase ==
note over User, Redis: Subsequent requests with JWT token
User -> Controller: GET /api/protected-resource
activate Controller
Controller -> AuthService: validateToken(jwt)
activate AuthService

AuthService -> Redis: getUserSession(userId)
activate Redis
Redis --> AuthService: SessionData
deactivate Redis

AuthService --> Controller: User permissions
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: Protected resource data
deactivate Controller
@enduml
```

### PlantUML-Specific Features

1. **Themes and Styling**:
- Use `!theme plain` or other themes for consistent styling

- Provide context and explanation for each diagram
- Link diagrams to relevant code sections

#### In package-info.java Files
- Reference sequence diagrams in package descriptions
- Include ASCII art versions for basic flows
- Link to external diagram files when appropriate

### Example Integration

**README.md Section**:
```markdown

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the user authentication process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant AuthController
participant AuthService
participant TokenService
participant Database

User -> AuthController: POST /api/auth/login
AuthController -> AuthService: authenticateUser(credentials)
AuthService -> Database: findByUsername(username)

alt Valid credentials
Database --> AuthService: User entity
AuthService -> TokenService: generateToken(user)
TokenService --> AuthService: JWT token
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthResult with token
AuthController --> User: 200 OK + JWT token
else Invalid credentials
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthenticationException
AuthController --> User: 401 Unauthorized
end
@enduml
```

This flow demonstrates how the application handles user authentication, including both successful login and failure scenarios.
```

### Validation

After generating sequence diagrams:

1. **Verify accuracy** against actual codebase

+ save(Entity): Entity
+ deleteById(Long): void
}

class EntityService {
- repository: Repository
+ EntityService(Repository)
+ findById(Long): Entity
+ save(Entity): Entity

#### Advanced Patterns

**Domain Model with Inheritance**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Domain Model Hierarchy

abstract class BaseEntity {
# id: Long
# createdAt: LocalDateTime
# updatedAt: LocalDateTime
+ getId(): Long
+ getCreatedAt(): LocalDateTime
{abstract} + validate(): boolean
}

class User extends BaseEntity {
- username: String
- email: String
- password: String
+ getUsername(): String
+ getEmail(): String
+ validate(): boolean
}

class Product extends BaseEntity {
- name: String
- price: BigDecimal
- category: Category
+ getName(): String
+ getPrice(): BigDecimal
+ validate(): boolean
}

enum Category {
ELECTRONICS
CLOTHING
BOOKS
+ getDisplayName(): String
}

class Order extends BaseEntity {
- user: User

- totalAmount: BigDecimal
+ addItem(OrderItem): void
+ calculateTotal(): BigDecimal
+ validate(): boolean
}

class OrderItem {
- product: Product
- quantity: Integer
- unitPrice: BigDecimal
+ getSubtotal(): BigDecimal
}

User ||--o{ Order : places
Order ||--o{ OrderItem : contains
OrderItem }o--|| Product : references
Product }o--|| Category : belongs to

note top of BaseEntity : All entities extend this base class\nfor common functionality

note right of Order : Calculates total from\ncontained OrderItems

### Analysis Process

**For each C4 level identified:**

1. **System Context Analysis**:
- Identify external users and personas
- Identify external systems and dependencies
- Define system boundaries and purpose
- Analyze integration points and data flows

2. **Container Analysis**:

title Order State Machine

[*] --> Created : create order

Created --> Validated : validate()
Created --> Cancelled : cancel()

Validated --> Paid : payment successful
Validated --> PaymentFailed : payment failed
Validated --> Cancelled : cancel()

PaymentFailed --> Validated : retry payment
PaymentFailed --> Cancelled : cancel after failure

Paid --> Shipped : ship order

Shipped --> Delivered : delivery confirmed
Shipped --> Returned : return requested

Delivered --> [*] : order complete
Returned --> Refunded : return processed

Inactive --> PendingVerification : register()
PendingVerification --> Active : verify email
PendingVerification --> Inactive : verification expired

state Active {

LoggedIn --> LoggedOut : session timeout

state LoggedIn {
[*] --> Normal
Normal --> Restricted : policy violation
Restricted --> Normal : restriction lifted
}
}

Active --> Suspended : suspend account
Suspended --> Active : reactivate()
Suspended --> Deleted : permanent deletion
Active --> Deleted : user deletion request

Deleted --> [*]

[*] --> ContentReview
ContentReview --> ContentApproved : approve content
ContentReview --> ContentRejected : reject content
ContentRejected --> ContentReview : resubmit

[*] --> TechnicalReview
TechnicalReview --> TechnicalApproved : approve technical
TechnicalReview --> TechnicalRejected : reject technical
TechnicalRejected --> TechnicalReview : fix and resubmit
}

Processing --> Published : [ContentApproved AND TechnicalApproved]
Processing --> Rejected : [ContentRejected OR TechnicalRejected] after max attempts

### Content Quality Requirements

1. **State Accuracy**: States must reflect actual object/process lifecycle in the codebase
2. **Transition Completeness**: Include all valid state transitions and their triggers
3. **Guard Conditions**: Document conditions that must be met for transitions
4. **Action Documentation**: Include actions performed during transitions or state entry/exit
5. **Business Logic Alignment**: Ensure state machines align with business rules and processes

### Integration Guidelines

1. **Code Analysis**: Use codebase_search to identify:
- Enum classes that represent states
- State pattern implementations
- Workflow orchestration code
- Business process implementations
- Entity lifecycle management code

2. **Documentation Integration**:
- Include state machine diagrams in relevant package-info.java files
- Add state machine sections to README.md for complex workflows
- Reference state machines in class-level Javadoc for stateful entities

3. **Naming Conventions**:
- Use clear, business-meaningful state names
- Follow consistent naming patterns across related state machines
- Include context in diagram titles (e.g., "Order Processing State Machine")

### Validation

After generating state machine diagrams:
1. **Verify PlantUML syntax** for proper rendering
2. **Validate against codebase** to ensure state accuracy
3. **Check transition completeness** - ensure all paths are covered
4. **Test business logic alignment** with actual implementation
5. **Ensure proper integration** with other documentation


## State Machine Analysis Process

**For each applicable state machine type:**

1. **Entity Lifecycles** (if selected):
- Analyze domain entities with clear state transitions
- Identify state-changing methods and business rules
- Document entity lifecycle from creation to completion/deletion
- Include state validation and transition constraints

2. **Business Workflows** (if selected):
- Analyze business process implementations
- Identify workflow orchestration patterns
- Document approval processes, payment flows, and operational workflows
- Include decision points and parallel processing paths

3. **System Behaviors** (if selected):
- Analyze system components with operational states
- Identify connection management, job processing, and transaction states
- Document error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Include timeout and retry logic patterns

4. **User Interactions** (if selected):
- Analyze UI components with interaction states
- Identify form wizards, dialog flows, and navigation patterns
- Document user journey state transitions
- Include validation and error state handling

## State Machine Generation Guidelines

1. **Use PlantUML syntax** for state machine diagrams to ensure compatibility and renderability
2. **Analyze actual code implementations** using codebase_search to identify:
- Enum classes representing states
- State pattern implementations
- Workflow orchestration code
- Business process state management
- Entity lifecycle management methods

3. **Include comprehensive state coverage**:
- Initial and final states
- All intermediate states with clear purposes
- Transition triggers, guards, and actions
- Concurrent states where applicable
- Error and exception states

4. **Document business logic alignment**:
- Ensure state machines reflect actual business rules
- Include guard conditions from code validation
- Show actions performed during state transitions
- Reference actual method names and class structures

## Integration Strategy

**Based on user documentation preferences:**

1. **README.md Integration** (if README generation was selected):
- Add "Business Logic" or "System Behavior" section
- Include key state machine diagrams with explanations
- Focus on user-facing workflows and entity lifecycles
- Link diagrams to relevant code sections

2. **Package Documentation Integration** (if package-info.java generation was selected):
- Include relevant state machine diagrams in package descriptions
- Show how package components participate in state transitions
- Reference state machines for stateful entities and services
- Document state-related design patterns

3. **Separate Behavioral Documentation**:
- Create dedicated behavior.md or workflows.md files
- Organize diagrams by business domain or system component
- Include comprehensive explanations for each state machine
- Provide cross-references between related state machines

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **State Accuracy**: Diagrams must reflect actual object and process lifecycles in the codebase
2. **Transition Completeness**: Include all valid state transitions with proper triggers and guards
3. **Business Logic Alignment**: Ensure state machines align with business rules and validation logic
4. **Implementation Consistency**: Reference actual class names, method names, and enum values
5. **Documentation Clarity**: Include clear state descriptions and transition explanations

## Validation

After generating state machine diagrams:
1. **Verify PlantUML syntax** for proper rendering
2. **Validate against codebase** to ensure state and transition accuracy
3. **Check business logic alignment** with actual implementation
4. **Test diagram completeness** covering all significant state transitions
5. **Ensure proper integration** with other documentation

#### Step Constraints

- **MUST** only execute if "UML state-machine diagrams" was selected in Step 1
- **MUST** use codebase_search extensively to analyze actual state implementations
- **MUST** generate accurate diagrams that reflect real state machine behavior
- **MUST** use proper PlantUML state machine diagram syntax

- **MUST** include guard conditions and transition actions where applicable
- **MUST** reference actual code structures (enums, classes, methods)
- **MUST NOT** generate generic or templated diagrams without code analysis
- **MUST** validate PlantUML syntax for renderability

### Step 8: Documentation Validation and Summary

**Purpose**: Validate all generated documentation and provide a comprehensive summary of changes made.

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of applicable steps (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and/or 7 based on user selections).

## Validation Process

1. **Compile Validation**:
```bash
# Validate that all package-info.java files compile correctly
./mvnw clean compile
```

2. **Content Validation**:
- Verify README.md files have proper markdown formatting
- Ensure all links and references are valid
- Check that software descriptions accurately reflect the codebase
- Validate that Javadoc in package-info.java files is syntactically correct

3. **Consistency Validation**:
- Ensure consistent documentation style across all generated files
- Verify that cross-references between files are accurate
- Check that naming conventions are followed
