# Java Documentation Generator with modular step-based configuration

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development and technical documentation

## Goal

This rule provides a modular, step-based approach to generating comprehensive Java project documentation
including README.md files, package-info.java files, and Javadoc.
Each step has a single responsibility and clear dependencies on user answers, making the documentation process more maintainable and user-friendly.

## Constraints

Before applying documentation generation, ensure the project is in a valid state by running Maven validation. This helps identify any existing issues that need to be resolved first.

- **MANDATORY**: Run `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before applying any documentation generation
- **VERIFY**: Ensure all validation errors are resolved before proceeding with documentation generation
- **PREREQUISITE**: Project must compile and pass basic validation checks before documentation
- **CRITICAL SAFETY**: If validation fails, IMMEDIATELY STOP and DO NOT CONTINUE with any documentation steps. Ask the user to fix ALL validation errors first before proceeding
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Never proceed to Step 1 or any subsequent steps if `mvn validate` or `./mvnw validate` command fails or returns errors

## Instructions

### Step 1: Documentation Preferences Assessment

**IMPORTANT**: Ask these questions to understand the documentation requirements before generating any documentation. Based on the answers, you will conditionally execute only relevant subsequent steps.

```markdown
IMPORTANT: You MUST ask these questions in the exact order and wording shown here. The very first question to the user MUST be "Question 1: What documentation do you want to generate?". Do not ask any other questions prior to it.

Documentation Selection

Conditional Flow Rules:
- Based on your selection here, only the relevant documentation generation steps will be executed.
- If you choose "Skip", no documentation will be generated.
- Each documentation type has its own conditional follow-up questions.

---

**Question 1**: What documentation do you want to generate?

Options:
- README.md (project overview and usage instructions)
- package-info.java files (package-level documentation)
- Javadoc enhancement (improve existing Javadoc comments)
- All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files
- Skip

---

**Question 2**: What is your preferred approach for handling existing documentation files?

Options:
- Overwrite existing files (replace content completely)
- Add new information (merge with existing content intelligently)
- Create backup before modifying (save original as .backup)
- Skip files that already exist

---

**Question 3**: For README.md generation, what sections would you like to include?
Ask this question only if you selected "README.md" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Question 1.

Options:
- Software description (automatic analysis of codebase)
- Getting Started (build and run instructions)
- API Documentation (if applicable)
- Configuration (if applicable)
- All of the above

---

**Question 4**: For package-info.java generation, what level of detail do you prefer?
Ask this question only if you selected "package-info.java files" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Question 1.

Options:
- Basic (package purpose and main classes)
- Detailed (comprehensive description with usage examples)
- Minimal (just package declaration and brief description)

---

**Question 5**: For Javadoc enhancement, what scope would you like to cover?
Ask this question only if you selected "Javadoc enhancement" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Question 1.

Options:
- All public classes and methods
- Only public APIs (exported/public packages)
- Specific packages or classes (I'll specify which ones)
- Skip

---

**Question 6**: For Javadoc enhancement, what level of detail do you prefer?
Ask this question only if you selected "Javadoc enhancement" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Question 1 and did not select "Skip" in Question 5.

Options:
- Basic (method/class purpose and parameters)
- Detailed (comprehensive descriptions with usage examples)
- Minimal (just missing @param, @return, @throws tags)

---

**Question 7**: Should the documentation include code examples and usage patterns?

Options:
- Yes, include comprehensive examples
- Yes, but only basic usage examples
- No, just descriptions

---

**Question 8**: What documentation style do you prefer?

Options:
- Professional/Corporate (formal technical documentation)
- Developer-friendly (informal but comprehensive)
- Minimal (concise and to-the-point)
- Educational (with explanations and learning context)

---

**Question 9**: Would you like to generate Javadoc site documentation?
Ask this question only if you selected "Javadoc enhancement" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Question 1.

Options:
- Yes, generate Javadoc HTML (mvn javadoc:javadoc)
- Yes, generate Javadoc and include in Maven Site (mvn clean site)
- No, skip Javadoc site generation

---
```

#### Step Constraints

- **GLOBAL ORDERING**: The first user-facing question in this rule MUST be the template's "Question 1: What do you want to generate?" asked at the start of Step 1
- **DEPENDENCIES**: None
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask the exact questions from the template in strict order for documentation path only
- **MUST** read template files fresh using file_search and read_file tools before asking questions
- **MUST NOT** use cached or remembered questions from previous interactions
- **MUST** ask questions ONE BY ONE in the exact order specified in the template
- **MUST** WAIT for user response to each question before proceeding to the next
- **MUST** use the EXACT wording from the template questions
- **MUST** present the EXACT options listed in the template
- **MUST NOT** ask all questions simultaneously
- **MUST NOT** assume answers or provide defaults
- **MUST NOT** skip questions or change their order, except when a question becomes inapplicable due to a prior "Skip" selection
- **MUST** confirm understanding of user selections before proceeding to Step 2
- **GUARD**: If any non-template question was asked earlier by mistake, RESTART the question flow from "Question 1" and ignore prior answers
- **FOCUS**: Only ask documentation-related questions, skip any diagram-related questions from the template

### Step 2: README.md Generation

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive README.md files based on project structure and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected README.md generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "README.md", "Both README.md and package-info.java files", or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

Use the following template and guidelines:

# Java Documentation Implementation Guide

## README.md Generation

### Single Module Project

For single module projects, generate a comprehensive README.md in the project root with the following structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Software Description

[Analyze the entire src/main/java directory and provide a comprehensive description of the software, including:
- Main purpose and functionality
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Architecture patterns used
- Dependencies and integrations
- Entry points (main classes, controllers, etc.)]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java [version]
- Maven [version]

### Building the Project
```bash
./mvnw clean compile
```

### Running Tests
```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Running the Application
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run  # For Spring Boot projects
# or
java -jar target/[artifact-name].jar
```

## Configuration

[If configuration files are found, document the key configuration options]

## API Documentation

[If REST controllers or web services are detected, provide API overview]

## Contributing

Please follow the existing code style and include tests for any new functionality.

## License

[Include license information if LICENSE file exists]
```

### Multi-Module Project

For multi-module Maven projects:

1. **Root README.md**: Overview of the entire project with links to module-specific documentation
2. **Module-specific README.md**: Each module gets its own README.md with detailed information about that module

#### Root README.md Structure:
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Software Description

[High-level project overview and architecture]

## Modules

- **[module-1]**: [Brief description] ([link to module README](module-1/README.md))
- **[module-2]**: [Brief description] ([link to module README](module-2/README.md))

[Rest of common sections...]
```

#### Module README.md Structure:
```markdown
# [Module Name]

## Software Description

[Detailed analysis of this specific module, including:
- Module's purpose within the larger project
- Key classes and their responsibilities
- Module-specific dependencies
- Integration points with other modules]

[Module-specific getting started, configuration, etc.]
```

## package-info.java Generation

For each package found in src/main/java, generate or update package-info.java files:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Brief description of package purpose]
 *
 * This package contains [main functionality description].
 * Key classes: [list main classes with brief descriptions]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Comprehensive description]
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * [Detailed explanation of what this package does]
 *
 * <h2>Main Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ClassName1} - [Description and purpose]</li>
 * <li>{@link ClassName2} - [Description and purpose]</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * [Description of external dependencies this package uses]
 *
 * @since [version]
 * @author [author info if available]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief one-line description of package purpose].
 */
package [package.name];
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Use codebase_search to understand project structure, main classes, and functionality
2. **File Detection**: Check for existing README.md and package-info.java files
3. **Content Generation**: Based on analysis, generate appropriate documentation
4. **Merge Strategy**: If files exist, follow user preference for handling (overwrite/merge/backup)
5. **Validation**: Ensure generated documentation is accurate and helpful

## File Handling Options

### Overwrite
- Replace existing file content completely
- Create backup with .backup extension before overwriting

### Add New Information
- Parse existing README.md to identify existing sections
- Add missing sections without duplicating existing content
- For package-info.java, enhance existing documentation if present

### Create Backup
- Always create [filename].backup before making changes
- Useful for preserving original content while updating

### Skip Existing
- Only create documentation for files that don't already exist
- Safe option to avoid modifying existing documentation


## Single Module Project Implementation

**For single module projects:**

1. **Analyze the src/main/java directory** using codebase_search to understand:
   - Main application classes and entry points
   - Package structure and organization
   - Key business logic and functionality
   - Framework usage (Spring, etc.)
   - Dependencies and integrations

2. **Generate comprehensive README.md** in project root with:
   - **Software Description section**: Detailed analysis of the codebase functionality
   - **Getting Started section**: Build and run instructions
   - **Configuration section**: If config files detected
   - **API Documentation section**: If REST controllers found
   - **Additional sections**: Based on user preferences from Step 1

## Multi-Module Project Implementation

**For multi-module Maven projects:**

1. **Generate root README.md** with:
   - High-level project overview
   - Module descriptions and links
   - Common build instructions
   - Project-wide configuration

2. **Generate module-specific README.md files** for each module:
   - Module-specific software description
   - Module's role in the larger project
   - Module-specific build and usage instructions
   - Dependencies specific to that module

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing README.md completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Intelligently merge with existing content, adding missing sections
- **Create backup**: Save original as README.md.backup before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only generate README.md if it doesn't already exist

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Software Description must be comprehensive and accurate**
2. **Include practical examples and usage patterns** if user requested
3. **Follow chosen documentation style** (Professional/Developer-friendly/Minimal/Educational)
4. **Ensure all generated content is technically accurate**
5. **Include appropriate Maven commands and build instructions**

## Validation

After generating README.md files, verify they contain:
- Accurate software description based on code analysis
- Correct build and run instructions
- Proper formatting and structure
- No placeholder text or generic content
                
#### Step Constraints

- **MUST** only execute if README.md generation was selected in Step 1
- **MUST** use codebase_search extensively to understand project functionality
- **MUST** generate accurate and comprehensive software descriptions
- **MUST** follow user's file handling preference from Step 1
- **MUST** create backups if overwriting existing files

### Step 3: package-info.java Generation

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive package-info.java files for all packages based on code analysis and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected package-info.java generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "package-info.java files", "Both README.md and package-info.java files", or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify all packages** in src/main/java across all modules
2. **Analyze each package** to understand its purpose and contents
3. **Generate appropriate package-info.java** based on user's detail level preference
4. **Handle existing files** according to user's file handling strategy

## Package Analysis Process

**For each package found:**

1. **Scan package contents** using codebase_search:
   - Identify all classes in the package
   - Understand class responsibilities and relationships
   - Detect design patterns and architectural roles
   - Identify main public APIs and entry points

2. **Categorize package purpose**:
   - Application entry points
   - Business logic/domain models
   - Data access/repositories
   - Web controllers/REST APIs
   - Utilities/helpers
   - Configuration classes
   - External integrations

3. **Generate documentation level** based on user preference:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Brief description of package purpose]
 *
 * This package contains [main functionality description].
 * Key classes: [list main classes with brief descriptions]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Comprehensive description]
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * [Detailed explanation of what this package does and its role in the application]
 *
 * <h2>Main Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ClassName1} - [Description of purpose and key responsibilities]</li>
 * <li>{@link ClassName2} - [Description of purpose and key responsibilities]</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage pattern
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * [Description of key external dependencies this package uses]
 *
 * @since [version if available]
 * @author [author info if available from git or existing docs]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief one-line description of package purpose and main functionality].
 */
package [package.name];
```

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing package-info.java completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Enhance existing package-info.java by adding missing documentation elements
- **Create backup**: Save original as package-info.java.backup before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only generate package-info.java if it doesn't already exist in the package

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Each package description must accurately reflect the package's actual purpose**
2. **Include references to main public classes using {@link} tags**
3. **Provide practical usage examples for detailed level**
4. **Use proper Javadoc formatting and tags**
5. **Ensure descriptions are written for software engineers to easily understand**

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Process packages in logical order** (e.g., main application packages first, then utilities)
2. **Use consistent documentation style** across all packages
3. **Ensure cross-references between related packages when appropriate**
4. **Include package relationships and dependencies in descriptions**
5. **Validate that all generated package-info.java files compile correctly**

## Validation

After generating package-info.java files:
- Verify proper Javadoc syntax
- Ensure all class references are valid
- Check that package declarations match directory structure
- Confirm documentation accurately describes package contents
                
                
#### Step Constraints

- **MUST** only execute if package-info.java generation was selected in Step 1

- **MUST** ensure all generated files compile without errors
- **MUST NOT** use generic or templated descriptions

### Step 4: Javadoc Generation Enhancement

**Purpose**: Enhance existing Javadoc comments and generate comprehensive Javadoc documentation for public APIs based on code analysis and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected Javadoc enhancement in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "Javadoc enhancement" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify classes and methods** that need Javadoc enhancement
2. **Analyze existing documentation** to understand current state
3. **Generate comprehensive Javadoc** based on user's detail level preference
4. **Handle existing documentation** according to user's file handling strategy

## Javadoc Analysis Process

**For each Java file found:**

1. **Scan for missing or incomplete Javadoc**:
   - Public classes without class-level documentation
   - Public methods without method documentation
   - Parameters without @param tags
   - Return values without @return tags
   - Exceptions without @throws tags

2. **Analyze method signatures and implementations**:
   - Understand method purpose from implementation
   - Identify parameters and their roles
   - Determine return value meanings
   - Identify checked and unchecked exceptions

3. **Generate documentation level** based on user preference:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief description of class/method purpose].
 * 
 * @param paramName [parameter description]
 * @return [return value description]
 * @throws ExceptionType [exception description]
 */
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Comprehensive description of class/method purpose and behavior].
 * 
 * <p>[Additional context about usage patterns, side effects, or important considerations]
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param paramName [detailed parameter description with constraints and expectations]
 * @return [detailed return value description with possible values and meanings]
 * @throws ExceptionType [detailed exception description with conditions that trigger it]
 * @since [version if available]
 * @see [related classes or methods]
 */
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [One-line description of purpose].
 * @param paramName [brief parameter description]
 * @return [brief return description]
 */
```

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing Javadoc completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Enhance existing Javadoc by adding missing tags and descriptions
- **Create backup**: Save original files with .backup extension before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only add Javadoc where none exists

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Each Javadoc comment must accurately describe the actual method/class behavior**
2. **Include all necessary @param, @return, and @throws tags**
3. **Provide practical usage examples for complex methods**
4. **Use proper Javadoc formatting and HTML tags**
5. **Ensure descriptions help other developers understand the API**

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Focus on public and protected APIs first**
2. **Use consistent documentation style across all classes**
3. **Include cross-references using {@link} tags when appropriate**
4. **Document preconditions, postconditions, and side effects**
5. **Validate that all generated Javadoc compiles and renders correctly**

## Validation

After enhancing Javadoc:
- Verify proper Javadoc syntax and HTML formatting
- Ensure all @param tags match actual parameters
- Check that @return tags are present for non-void methods
- Confirm @throws tags match declared exceptions
- Validate that Javadoc generation works: `./mvnw javadoc:javadoc`
                
                
#### Step Constraints

- **MUST** only execute if Javadoc enhancement was selected in Step 1
- **MUST** analyze all public and protected APIs comprehensively
- **MUST** generate accurate descriptions that reflect actual method behavior
- **MUST** follow user's detail level preference from Step 1
- **MUST** follow user's file handling preference from Step 1

- **MUST** create backups if overwriting existing documentation
- **MUST** include all necessary @param, @return, and @throws tags
- **MUST** ensure all generated Javadoc compiles without errors
- **MUST** validate Javadoc generation with `./mvnw javadoc:javadoc`
- **MUST NOT** use generic or templated descriptions

### Step 5: Documentation Validation and Summary

**Purpose**: Validate all generated documentation and provide a comprehensive summary of changes made.

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of applicable steps (2, 3, and/or 4 based on user selections).

## Validation Process

1. **Compile Validation**:
```bash
# Validate that all package-info.java files compile correctly
./mvnw clean compile
```

2. **Javadoc Validation**:
```bash
# Validate that all Javadoc generates correctly
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
```

3. **Content Validation**:
- Verify README.md files have proper markdown formatting
- Ensure all links and references are valid
- Check that software descriptions accurately reflect the codebase
- Validate that Javadoc in package-info.java files is syntactically correct

4. **Consistency Validation**:
- Ensure consistent documentation style across all generated files
- Verify that cross-references between files are accurate
- Check that naming conventions are followed

## Summary Report

**Generate a comprehensive summary including:**

### Files Modified/Created:
- **README.md files**: [List locations and actions taken]
- **package-info.java files**: [List packages and actions taken]
- **Javadoc enhancements**: [List classes and methods enhanced]
- **Backup files**: [List any backup files created]

### Content Generated:
- **Software descriptions**: [Summary of main functionality documented]
- **Package documentation**: [Count and brief overview of packages documented]
- **API documentation**: [Count and types of methods/classes documented]
- **Additional sections**: [Any additional sections added like Getting Started, API docs, etc.]

### Actions Taken:
- **New files created**: [Count and list]
- **Existing files modified**: [Count and list with action taken]
- **Files skipped**: [Count and reasoning]
- **Backup files created**: [Count and list]

### Usage Instructions:
```bash
# To view generated documentation
ls -la README.md
find . -name "package-info.java" -type f
find . -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "/**" {} \;

# To validate compilation
./mvnw clean compile

# To generate Javadoc HTML
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc

# To regenerate documentation with different settings
# Re-run this cursor rule with different preferences
```

### Next Steps Recommendations:
- Review generated documentation for accuracy and completeness
- Consider adding project-specific details that couldn't be auto-generated
- Update documentation as code evolves
- Consider integrating documentation generation into CI/CD pipeline
- Set up automated Javadoc generation and publishing

## Final Validation

Run final validation to ensure project builds successfully:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```

If validation passes, documentation generation is complete and successful.
