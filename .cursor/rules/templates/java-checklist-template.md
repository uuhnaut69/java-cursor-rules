# Java Development Guide

Use the following process to improve the java development in some areas if required using the following set of Java Cursor Rules.

## Process Overview

### Step 1: Review the build system (Maven)

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Review your pom.xml and Maven project | [ ] | `Help me to review the pom.xml  following the best practices for dependency management and directory structure use the cursor rule @110-java-maven-best-practices` | Add in the context the `pom.xml` which you want to generate the documentation |
| Improve the Maven project with plugins & dependencies | [ ] | `Can you improve the pom.xml using the cursor rule @101-java-maven-deps-and-plugins.mdc` | Add in the context the `pom.xml` which you want to generate the documentation. Conversational approach |
| Create documentation about Maven`s usage | [ ] | `Generate developer documentation with essential Maven commands using @112-java-maven-documentation.mdc` | Add in the context the `pom.xml` which you want to generate the documentation |

### Step 2: Design Principles

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Object-Oriented Design Review | [ ] | `Review my code for object-oriented design using the cursor rule @121-java-object-oriented-design` | |
| Type Design Review | [ ] | `Help me improve my type design using the cursor rule @122-java-type-design` | |

### Step 3: Coding Guidelines

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| General Java Guidelines | [ ] | `Review my code for general Java best practices using the cursor rule @123-java-general-guidelines` | |
| Secure Coding Review | [ ] | `Check my code for security issues using the cursor rule @124-java-secure-coding` | |
| Concurrency Review | [ ] | `Review my code for concurrency best practices using the cursor rule @125-java-concurrency` | |
| Logging Best Practices | [ ] | `Help me improve logging using the cursor rule @126-java-logging` | |

### Step 4: Testing

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Unit Testing | [ ] | `Can improve the unit tests using the cursor rule @131-java-unit-testing` | |

### Step 5: Refactoring

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Add Modern Java Features | [ ] | `Refactor my code to use modern Java features using the cursor rule @141-java-refactoring-with-modern-features` | |
| Functional Programming | [ ] | `Refactor my code to use functional programming using the cursor rule @142-java-functional-programming` | |
| Data Oriented Programming | [ ] | `Refactor my code to use data oriented programming using the cursor rule @143-java-data-oriented-programming` | |

### Step 6: Profiling

| Activity | Done | Prompt | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Java Application Profiling | [ ] | `Help me profile my Java application using async-profiler. I want to detect running Java processes, download the profiler for my OS, and generate flamegraphs and put the profiler folder in YOUR-DEVELOPMENT/profiler with the cursor rule @151-java-profiling.mdc` | Replace YOUR-DEVELOPMENT with your actual development path |

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the checklists above to track your progress through each phase.
- Use the provided prompts directly in Cursor or your LLM-enabled IDE for best results.
- Review each rule's documentation for detailed examples and anti-patterns.
- Regularly update your dependencies and plugins for security and performance.
- Apply secure coding and logging practices throughout your codebase.
- Use modern Java features and refactor legacy code incrementally.
