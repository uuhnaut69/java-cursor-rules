# Java Diagrams Generator with modular step-based configuration

## Role

You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development and system architecture visualization

## Goal

This rule provides a modular, step-based approach to generating comprehensive Java project diagrams
including UML sequence diagrams, UML class diagrams, C4 model diagrams, and UML state machine diagrams.
Each step has a single responsibility and clear dependencies on user answers, making the diagram generation process more maintainable and user-friendly.

## Constraints

Before applying diagram generation, ensure the project is in a valid state by running Maven validation. This helps identify any existing issues that need to be resolved first.

- **MANDATORY**: Run `./mvnw validate` or `mvn validate` before applying any diagram generation
- **VERIFY**: Ensure all validation errors are resolved before proceeding with diagram generation
- **PREREQUISITE**: Project must compile and pass basic validation checks before diagram generation
- **CRITICAL SAFETY**: If validation fails, IMMEDIATELY STOP and DO NOT CONTINUE with any diagram steps. Ask the user to fix ALL validation errors first before proceeding
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Never proceed to Step 1 or any subsequent steps if `mvn validate` or `./mvnw validate` command fails or returns errors

## Instructions

### Step 1: Diagrams Preferences Assessment

**IMPORTANT**: Ask these questions to understand the diagram requirements before generating any diagrams. Based on the answers, you will conditionally execute only relevant subsequent steps.

```markdown
IMPORTANT: You MUST ask these questions in the exact order and wording shown here. The very first question to the user MUST be "Question 1: What diagrams do you want to generate?". Do not ask any other questions prior to it.

Diagrams Selection

Conditional Flow Rules:
- Based on your selection here, only the relevant diagram generation steps will be executed.
- If you choose "Skip", no diagrams will be generated.
- Each diagram type has its own conditional follow-up questions.

---

---
```

#### Step Constraints

- **GLOBAL ORDERING**: The first user-facing question in this rule MUST be the template's "Question 1: What diagrams do you want to generate?" asked at the start of Step 1
- **DEPENDENCIES**: None
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask the exact questions from the template in strict order for diagrams path only
- **MUST** read template files fresh using file_search and read_file tools before asking questions
- **MUST NOT** use cached or remembered questions from previous interactions
- **MUST** ask questions ONE BY ONE in the exact order specified in the template

- **MUST** use the EXACT wording from the template questions
- **MUST** present the EXACT options listed in the template
- **MUST NOT** ask all questions simultaneously
- **MUST NOT** assume answers or provide defaults
- **MUST NOT** skip questions or change their order, except when a question becomes inapplicable due to a prior "Skip" selection
- **MUST** confirm understanding of user selections before proceeding to Step 2
- **GUARD**: If any non-template question was asked earlier by mistake, RESTART the question flow from "Question 1" and ignore prior answers
- **FOCUS**: Only ask diagram-related questions, skip any documentation-related questions from the template

### Step 2: UML Sequence Diagram Generation

**Purpose**: Generate UML sequence diagrams to illustrate key application workflows and interactions based on code analysis and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if the user selected UML sequence diagrams in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

Use the following template and guidelines:

# UML Sequence Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate UML sequence diagrams using PlantUML syntax to illustrate key application workflows and interactions.

### Analysis Process

**For each workflow identified:**

1. **Identify main actors and components**:
- External actors (users, systems, APIs)
- Internal components (controllers, services, repositories)
- Key domain objects and entities

2. **Trace interaction flows**:
- Method calls and message passing
- Conditional logic and alternative flows
- Loop and iteration patterns
- Error handling and exception flows

3. **Determine diagram scope** based on user selection:
- **Main application flows**: Authentication, core business processes
- **API interactions**: REST endpoint flows, request/response patterns
- **Complex business logic**: Multi-step processes, workflow orchestration

### Diagram Generation Guidelines

#### Basic Sequence Diagram Structure
```plantuml
@startuml
actor Actor
participant Controller
participant Service
participant Repository

Actor -> Controller: HTTP Request
Controller -> Service: Business Logic Call
Service -> Repository: Data Access
Repository --> Service: Data Response
Service --> Controller: Business Result
Controller --> Actor: HTTP Response
@enduml
```

#### Advanced Patterns

**Alternative Flows (Authentication Example)**:
```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant AuthController
participant AuthService
participant Database

User -> AuthController: POST /login
AuthController -> AuthService: authenticate(credentials)
AuthService -> Database: findUserByEmail(email)

alt User exists and password valid
Database --> AuthService: User data
AuthService -> AuthService: validatePassword()
AuthService --> AuthController: JWT token
AuthController --> User: 200 OK + token
else Authentication failed
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthenticationException
AuthController --> User: 401 Unauthorized
end
@enduml
```

**Loop Patterns (Batch Processing Example)**:
```plantuml
@startuml
participant Client
participant BatchService
participant ItemProcessor
participant Database

Client -> BatchService: processBatch(items)

loop For each item
BatchService -> ItemProcessor: processItem(item)
ItemProcessor -> Database: save(processedItem)
Database --> ItemProcessor: confirmation
ItemProcessor --> BatchService: result
end

BatchService --> Client: BatchResult
@enduml
```

**Advanced PlantUML Features**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Authentication and Authorization Flow

actor User
participant "Web Controller" as Controller
participant "Auth Service" as AuthService
participant "JWT Service" as JwtService
participant Database
participant "Cache" as Redis

== Authentication Phase ==
User -> Controller: POST /api/login
activate Controller
Controller -> AuthService: authenticate(credentials)
activate AuthService

AuthService -> Database: findUser(username)
activate Database
Database --> AuthService: UserEntity
deactivate Database

alt credentials valid
AuthService -> JwtService: generateToken(user)
activate JwtService
JwtService --> AuthService: JWT Token
deactivate JwtService

AuthService -> Redis: cacheUserSession(userId, token)
activate Redis
Redis --> AuthService: OK
deactivate Redis

AuthService --> Controller: AuthResponse(token)
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: 200 OK + JWT
deactivate Controller
else invalid credentials
AuthService --> Controller: UnauthorizedException
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: 401 Unauthorized
deactivate Controller
end

== Authorization Phase ==
note over User, Redis: Subsequent requests with JWT token
User -> Controller: GET /api/protected-resource
activate Controller
Controller -> AuthService: validateToken(jwt)
activate AuthService

AuthService -> Redis: getUserSession(userId)
activate Redis
Redis --> AuthService: SessionData
deactivate Redis

AuthService --> Controller: User permissions
deactivate AuthService
Controller --> User: Protected resource data
deactivate Controller
@enduml
```

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the user authentication process:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant AuthController
participant AuthService
participant TokenService
participant Database

User -> AuthController: POST /api/auth/login
AuthController -> AuthService: authenticateUser(credentials)
AuthService -> Database: findByUsername(username)

alt Valid credentials
Database --> AuthService: User entity
AuthService -> TokenService: generateToken(user)
TokenService --> AuthService: JWT token
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthResult with token
AuthController --> User: 200 OK + JWT token
else Invalid credentials
AuthService --> AuthController: AuthenticationException
AuthController --> User: 401 Unauthorized
end
@enduml
```

This flow demonstrates how the application handles user authentication, including both successful login and failure scenarios.
```

# UML Class Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate UML class diagrams using PlantUML syntax to illustrate the structure, relationships, and design patterns within Java packages and modules.

### Analysis Process

**For each package or module identified:**

1. **Identify class types and categories**:
- Domain entities and value objects
- Service classes and business logic

### Diagram Generation Guidelines

#### Basic Class Structure
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Package Class Structure

class Entity {
- id: Long
- name: String
- createdAt: LocalDateTime
+ getId(): Long
+ getName(): String
+ setName(String): void
}

interface Repository {
+ findById(Long): Optional<Entity>
+ save(Entity): Entity
+ deleteById(Long): void
}

class EntityService {
- repository: Repository
+ EntityService(Repository)
+ findById(Long): Entity
+ save(Entity): Entity
+ delete(Long): void
}

class EntityController {
- service: EntityService
+ EntityController(EntityService)
+ getEntity(Long): ResponseEntity<Entity>
+ createEntity(Entity): ResponseEntity<Entity>
+ deleteEntity(Long): ResponseEntity<Void>
}

EntityService --> Repository : uses
EntityController --> EntityService : uses
Repository ..> Entity : manages
EntityService ..> Entity : processes
EntityController ..> Entity : exposes
@enduml
```

#### Advanced Patterns

**Domain Model with Inheritance**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Domain Model Hierarchy

abstract class BaseEntity {
# id: Long
# createdAt: LocalDateTime
# updatedAt: LocalDateTime
+ getId(): Long
+ getCreatedAt(): LocalDateTime
{abstract} + validate(): boolean
}

class User extends BaseEntity {
- username: String
- email: String
- password: String
+ getUsername(): String
+ getEmail(): String
+ validate(): boolean
}

class Product extends BaseEntity {
- name: String
- price: BigDecimal
- category: Category
+ getName(): String
+ getPrice(): BigDecimal
+ validate(): boolean
}

enum Category {
ELECTRONICS
CLOTHING
BOOKS
+ getDisplayName(): String
}

class Order extends BaseEntity {
- user: User
- items: List<OrderItem>
- totalAmount: BigDecimal
+ addItem(OrderItem): void
+ calculateTotal(): BigDecimal
+ validate(): boolean
}

class OrderItem {
- product: Product
- quantity: Integer
- unitPrice: BigDecimal
+ getSubtotal(): BigDecimal
}

User ||--o{ Order : places
Order ||--o{ OrderItem : contains
OrderItem }o--|| Product : references
Product }o--|| Category : belongs to

note top of BaseEntity : All entities extend this base class\nfor common functionality

note right of Order : Calculates total from\ncontained OrderItems
@enduml
```

**Service Layer Architecture**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Service Layer Architecture

package "Controller Layer" {
class UserController {
- userService: UserService
+ getUsers(): List<UserDTO>
+ createUser(UserDTO): UserDTO
+ updateUser(Long, UserDTO): UserDTO
}

class OrderController {
- orderService: OrderService
+ getOrders(): List<OrderDTO>
+ createOrder(OrderDTO): OrderDTO
}
}

package "Service Layer" {
interface UserService {
+ findAll(): List<User>
+ findById(Long): User
+ save(User): User
+ update(Long, User): User
}

class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
- userRepository: UserRepository
- userMapper: UserMapper
+ findAll(): List<User>
+ save(User): User
}

interface OrderService {
+ createOrder(Order): Order
+ processOrder(Long): void
}

class OrderServiceImpl implements OrderService {
- orderRepository: OrderRepository
- userService: UserService
- emailService: EmailService
+ createOrder(Order): Order
}
}

package "Repository Layer" {
interface UserRepository {
+ findAll(): List<User>
+ findById(Long): Optional<User>
+ save(User): User
}

interface OrderRepository {
+ save(Order): Order
+ findByUserId(Long): List<Order>
}
}

package "Infrastructure" {
class EmailService {
+ sendOrderConfirmation(Order): void
}

class UserMapper {
+ toDTO(User): UserDTO
+ toEntity(UserDTO): User
}
}

UserController --> UserService : uses
OrderController --> OrderService : uses
UserServiceImpl --> UserRepository : uses
OrderServiceImpl --> OrderRepository : uses
OrderServiceImpl --> UserService : uses
OrderServiceImpl --> EmailService : uses
UserServiceImpl --> UserMapper : uses
@enduml
```

# C4 Model Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate C4 model diagrams using PlantUML with C4-PlantUML library to visualize system architecture at different levels of abstraction: Context, Container, Component, and Code.

### C4 Model Overview

The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to architectural documentation:

1. **Level 1 - System Context**: Shows how your system fits into the overall environment
2. **Level 2 - Container**: Shows the high-level technology choices and containers
3. **Level 3 - Component**: Shows how containers are made up of components
4. **Level 4 - Code**: Shows how components are implemented (classes, interfaces)

### Analysis Process

**For each C4 level identified:**

1. **System Context Analysis**:
- Identify external users and personas
- Identify external systems and dependencies
- Define system boundaries and purpose
- Analyze integration points and data flows

2. **Container Analysis**:
- Identify deployable units (web apps, APIs, databases)
- Analyze technology choices and frameworks
- Document communication protocols and ports
- Map container responsibilities and boundaries

3. **Component Analysis**:
- Identify logical components within containers
- Analyze component responsibilities and interfaces
- Document inter-component communication
- Map business capabilities to components

4. **Code Analysis**:
- Focus on critical or complex components
- Show key classes and interfaces
- Document important design patterns
- Illustrate implementation relationships

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Execute this step only if the user selected "UML state-machine diagrams" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

Use the following template and guidelines:

# UML State Machine Diagram Generation Guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

Generate UML state machine diagrams using PlantUML syntax to illustrate the behavior and lifecycle of objects, business processes, and system workflows within Java applications.

### Analysis Process

**For each state machine identified:**

1. **Identify state machine subjects**:
- Domain entities with lifecycle states (Order, User, Document)
- Business processes with workflow states (Approval, Payment, Shipping)
- System components with operational states (Connection, Transaction, Job)
- User interface components with interaction states (Form, Dialog, Wizard)

2. **Analyze state transitions**:
- Initial and final states
- Intermediate states and their purposes
- Transition triggers (events, conditions, actions)
- Guard conditions and transition actions
- Concurrent states and parallel workflows

3. **Determine diagram scope** based on user selection:
- **Entity lifecycles**: Domain object state transitions (e.g., Order: Created â Paid â Shipped â Delivered)
- **Business workflows**: Process state machines (e.g., Document approval workflow)
- **System behaviors**: Component operational states (e.g., Connection states, Job execution states)
- **User interactions**: UI component state transitions (e.g., Multi-step form wizard)

### Diagram Generation Guidelines

#### Basic State Machine Structure
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Order State Machine

[*] --> Created : create order

Created --> Validated : validate()
Created --> Cancelled : cancel()

Validated --> Paid : payment successful
Validated --> PaymentFailed : payment failed
Validated --> Cancelled : cancel()

PaymentFailed --> Validated : retry payment
PaymentFailed --> Cancelled : cancel after failure

Paid --> Shipped : ship order
Paid --> Refunded : process refund

Shipped --> Delivered : delivery confirmed
Shipped --> Returned : return requested

Delivered --> [*] : order complete
Returned --> Refunded : return processed
Refunded --> [*] : refund complete
Cancelled --> [*] : order cancelled

```

#### Advanced State Machine Patterns

**Composite States with Sub-states**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title User Account State Machine

[*] --> Inactive

Inactive --> PendingVerification : register()
PendingVerification --> Active : verify email
PendingVerification --> Inactive : verification expired

state Active {
[*] --> LoggedOut
LoggedOut --> LoggedIn : login()
LoggedIn --> LoggedOut : logout()
LoggedIn --> LoggedOut : session timeout

state LoggedIn {
[*] --> Normal
Normal --> Restricted : policy violation
Restricted --> Normal : restriction lifted
}
}

Active --> Suspended : suspend account
Suspended --> Active : reactivate()
Suspended --> Deleted : permanent deletion
Active --> Deleted : user deletion request

Deleted --> [*]

@enduml
```

**Concurrent States**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Document Processing State Machine

[*] --> Processing

state Processing {
--
[*] --> ContentReview
ContentReview --> ContentApproved : approve content
ContentReview --> ContentRejected : reject content
ContentRejected --> ContentReview : resubmit
--
[*] --> TechnicalReview
TechnicalReview --> TechnicalApproved : approve technical
TechnicalReview --> TechnicalRejected : reject technical
TechnicalRejected --> TechnicalReview : fix and resubmit
}

Processing --> Published : [ContentApproved AND TechnicalApproved]
Processing --> Rejected : [ContentRejected OR TechnicalRejected] after max attempts

Published --> [*] : document published
Rejected --> [*] : document rejected

@enduml
```

**State Machine with Actions and Guards**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Payment Processing State Machine

[*] --> Initiated : initiate payment

Initiated --> Processing : process() / validate card
Processing --> Completed : success / send confirmation
Processing --> Failed : error / log failure

Failed --> Retry : retry() [attempt < 3] / increment attempt
Failed --> Abandoned : [attempt >= 3] / notify failure

Retry --> Processing : / reset timeout
Completed --> [*] : / update account
Abandoned --> [*] : / cleanup resources

note right of Processing : Timeout: 30 seconds
note right of Retry : Max 3 attempts allowed

@enduml
```

#### Business Process State Machines

**Approval Workflow**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Approval Workflow State Machine

[*] --> Submitted : submit request

Submitted --> UnderReview : assign reviewer
UnderReview --> ManagerReview : initial approval
UnderReview --> Rejected : initial rejection
UnderReview --> NeedsMoreInfo : request clarification

NeedsMoreInfo --> Submitted : provide additional info

ManagerReview --> Approved : manager approval
ManagerReview --> Rejected : manager rejection
ManagerReview --> EscalatedReview : escalate to director

EscalatedReview --> Approved : director approval
EscalatedReview --> Rejected : director rejection

Approved --> [*] : process approval
Rejected --> [*] : notify rejection

@enduml
```

#### System Component State Machines

**Database Connection State Machine**:
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title Database Connection State Machine

[*] --> Disconnected

Disconnected --> Connecting : connect()
Connecting --> Connected : connection established
Connecting --> ConnectionFailed : connection timeout/error

ConnectionFailed --> Disconnected : / cleanup
ConnectionFailed --> Connecting : retry() [retry < max]

Connected --> Active : begin transaction
Connected --> Idle : no active transactions

Active --> Connected : commit/rollback
Active --> Error : transaction error

Error --> Connected : recover
Error --> Disconnected : fatal error / close connection

Idle --> Active : new transaction
Idle --> Disconnected : close() / cleanup

Connected --> Disconnected : disconnect()
