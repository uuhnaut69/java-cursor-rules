## Comparison Overview

| Factors | Description | Cursor | JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA + Cursor CLI | JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA + Claude Code CLI | GitHub Copilot (Free tier) | JetBrains Junie |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Usability** | Ease of use and user interface design. | 游릭 Excellent (Drag and Drop) | 游릭 Good | 游릭 Good | 游릭 Excellent (Drag and Drop) | 游릭 Excellent (Drag and Drop) |
| **Response Speed** | Measure the capacity of the different tools to reply user. | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游리 Slow (Connection issues with Models, slow experience in compare to other alternatives but a progress with previous Junie version) |
| **Reasoning** | Measure the level of reasoning in the different alternatives. | 游릭 Excellent (The environment generated todo list in order to structure the execution) | 游릭 Excellent (The environment generated todo list in order to structure the execution) | 游릭 Excellent (The environment generated todo list in order to structure the execution) | 游리 Limited (Reasoning requires more analysis time) | 游릭 Excellent (The environment generated todo list in order to structure the execution) |
| **Model Support** | Available AI models and their capabilities. | 游릭 Multiple models | 游릭 Multiple models | 游리 Claude 4 Sonnet | 游댮 Poor (In Free tier. Only Chat GPT 4.1 provide good answers) | 游리 Limited options |
| **Expected behaviour** | Measure the capacity to return the expected behaviour for Interactive System prompts and non Interactive System prompts. | 游릭 Excellent | 游리 Good (CLI doesn췂t behave 100% the same than Cursor IDE. Example: 170-java-documentation) | 游릭 Excellent | 游리 Good (Limited to few Java classes) | 游댮 Not always show the alternatives to take decisions (Limited to one one unique Java class to receive stable results.) Not always find the right project to analyze in scenarios with repositories with multiple projects organized in folders. Alternatives in some cases doesn췂t appear, or appear in an external document. Sometimes, apply changes in Java classes not included in the context |
| **Context window** | Measure the capacity to add packages or large set of folders. | 游릭 Multiple | 游릭 Multiple | 游릭 Multiple | 游리 Few classes | 游리 Few classes (Non necessary message "Scroll down" which appear when adding large documents) |
| **Terminal interaction** | Capacity to execute terminal commands described in System prompts. | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游댮 Not always (Restrictions & Safeguards are skipped) | 游릭 Excellent |
| **Understand Prompting parts** | Capacity to understand all parts from a prompt. | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游댮  Not always (Restrictions & Safeguards are skipped) | 游릭 Good support |
| **Rollback support** | Capacity to rollback to previous state after changes. | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游리 Not always | 游리 Not always (Example: `Create a document with all cursor rules for Java using the cursor rule @100-java-cursor-rules-list, In scenarios touching Tests) |
| **File system support** | Capacity to discover the files added in context in relation to the physical file system. | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游릭 Excellent | 游리 Not always | 游리 Limited (It is more accurate to add in the context the files, not the path) |

## Notes

- **Jetbrains Junie:** Huge evolution in positive sense from *ej-eap-252.204.98*
- **Cursor CLI:** Pretty interesting alternative with the new product Cursor CLI (cursor-agent) but the behaviour is not 100% the same than Cursor IDE.

## Recommendations

- Currently the best environments to use this repository are: Cursor, Cursor CLI & Claude Code. If you use Jetbrains Intellij, you could combine with Cursor Cli or Claude code.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks Cursor & Jetbrains for the product support.
