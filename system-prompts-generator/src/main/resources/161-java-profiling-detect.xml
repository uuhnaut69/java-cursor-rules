        <title>Java Profiling Workflow / Step 1 / Collect data to measure potential issues</title>
    </metadata>

    <role>You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development</role>

    <goal>
        This cursor rule provides a comprehensive Java application profiling framework designed to detect and measure performance issues systematically.
        It serves as the first step in a structured profiling workflow, focusing on data collection and problem identification using async-profiler v4.0.

        The rule automates the entire profiling setup process, from detecting running Java processes to downloading and configuring the appropriate profiler tools for your system.
        It provides interactive scripts that guide you through identifying specific performance problems (CPU hotspots, memory leaks, concurrency issues, GC problems, or I/O bottlenecks) and then executes targeted profiling commands to collect relevant performance data.

        Key capabilities include:
        - **Automated Environment Setup**: Detects OS/architecture and downloads async-profiler v4.0 automatically
        - **Problem-Driven Profiling**: Guides users through identifying specific performance issues before profiling
        - **Interactive Workflow**: Provides menu-driven interface for selecting appropriate profiling strategies
        - **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Supports CPU profiling, memory allocation tracking, lock contention analysis, GC monitoring, and I/O bottleneck detection
        - **Modern Tooling**: Leverages async-profiler v4.0 features including interactive heatmaps, native memory leak detection, and enhanced JFR conversion
        - **Enhanced JFR Integration (Java 25)**: Utilizes JEP 518 (JFR Cooperative Sampling) and JEP 520 (JFR Method Timing &amp; Tracing) for improved profiling accuracy and reduced overhead
        - **Advanced Sampling**: Benefits from cooperative sampling techniques that minimize profiling impact while maintaining measurement precision
        - **Organized Results**: Maintains clean directory structure with timestamped results for easy analysis and comparison

        The rule ensures consistent, repeatable profiling procedures while providing the flexibility to target specific performance concerns based on your application's behavior and suspected issues.

        The profiling setup uses a clean folder structure with everything contained in the profiler directory:

        ```text
        your-project/
        ├── run-java-process-for-profiling.sh    # ← Step 1: Run main application with profiling JVM flags
        └── profiler/                            # ← All profiling-related files
            ├── scripts/                         # ← Profiling scripts and tools
            │   └── profile-java-process.sh      # ← Step 2: Interactive profiling script

            └── async-profiler-*/                # ← Downloaded profiler binaries
        ```

                <step-title>Setup Application Runner Script</step-title>
                <step-content>
**IMPORTANT**: Use the exact bash script from the template without any modification or interpretation.

```bash
<xi:include href="fragments/run-java-process-for-profiling.sh" parse="text"/>
```

**Script Location:**
```
your-project/
└── run-with-profiler.sh    # ← Run main application with the right JVM flags for profiling
```

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Copy the **EXACT** bash script content from `run-java-process-for-profiling.sh`
2. Save it as `run-java-process-for-profiling.sh` in your project root
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x run-java-process-for-profiling.sh`
4. **NO MODIFICATIONS** to the script content are needed or allowed

**Purpose:**
- Configures JVM with profiling-friendly flags
- Ensures proper async-profiler compatibility
- Starts your application ready for profiling

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start your application with profiling-ready JVM settings
./run-java-process-for-profiling.sh
```
