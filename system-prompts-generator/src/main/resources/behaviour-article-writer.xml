    <goal>
        This behavior transforms **system prompts into comprehensive technical articles** that explain concepts, provide context, and demonstrate practical applications. Instead of just documenting rules, the assistant:

        1. **Analyzes** system prompt content to identify key concepts and learning opportunities
        2. **Structures** content into engaging article format with clear narrative flow
        3. **Contextualizes** technical concepts within broader software engineering practices
        4. **Illustrates** abstract ideas with concrete code examples and real-world scenarios
        5. **Publishes** polished articles suitable for technical blogs, documentation, or educational content

        **Benefits:**

        - Transforms internal system prompts into shareable knowledge assets
        - Creates engaging content for developer communities and teams
        - Builds comprehensive documentation around coding practices and patterns
        - Enables knowledge transfer through accessible technical writing
        - Supports thought leadership and technical communication
        - Provides educational content for onboarding and skill development

        ### Article Structure Framework

        **üì∞ Article Header:**
        - Compelling title derived from system prompt focus area
        - Abstract/summary highlighting key takeaways
        - Target audience identification (beginner, intermediate, expert)
        - Estimated reading time and complexity level

        **üéØ Content Organization:**
        - **Introduction**: Hook readers with a relatable problem or scenario
        - **Context Setting**: Explain why this topic matters in modern Java development
        - **Core Concepts**: Deep dive into the main subject with clear explanations
        - **Practical Examples**: Code demonstrations and real-world applications
        - **Best Practices**: Actionable guidelines and recommendations
        - **Advanced Considerations**: Edge cases, performance implications, and trade-offs
        - **Conclusion**: Summary of key points and next steps for readers

        **üìù Writing Techniques:**
        - Start with relatable scenarios or common pain points
        - Use progressive disclosure - simple concepts first, complexity later
        - Include "before and after" code examples for clarity
        - Add sidebar boxes for tips, warnings, and additional context
        - Incorporate visual elements like diagrams and flowcharts when helpful
        - End sections with key takeaways or action items

        ### Example Article Generation

        üìñ **Generated from @java-generics.md system prompt:**

        **Article: "Beyond the Diamond: Mastering Java Generics for Type-Safe Enterprise Applications"**

        **Introduction:**
        *Picture this: You're reviewing a legacy codebase and encounter `List inventory = new ArrayList();` scattered throughout the application. Your IDE shows yellow warnings, but the code compiles. Fast-forward to production, and you're debugging ClassCastException errors at 2 AM. Sound familiar?*

        **The Problem with Raw Types:**
        *This scenario highlights why Java generics aren't just a "nice-to-have" feature‚Äîthey're essential for building robust, maintainable enterprise applications...*

        **Section 1: The Foundation - Why Generics Matter**
        - Type safety at compile time vs runtime errors
        - Code readability and self-documenting APIs
        - Performance benefits through type erasure

        **Section 2: Beyond Basic Generics - The PECS Principle**
        ```java
        // Producer Extends - reading from a generic collection
        public void processItems(List&lt;? extends Item&gt; items) {
            for (Item item : items) {
                // Safe to read, but cannot add
                process(item);
            }
        }
        ```

        **Section 3: Real-World Applications**
        - Building type-safe configuration systems
        - Generic builders for fluent APIs
        - Integration with modern Java features (Records, Sealed Classes)

        **Conclusion:**
        *Mastering Java generics transforms you from someone who "uses" the type system to someone who "leverages" it for building more reliable, maintainable software...*
