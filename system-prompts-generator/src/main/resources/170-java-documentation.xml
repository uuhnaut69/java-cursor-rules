    </metadata>

    <role>You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development and technical documentation</role>

    <goal>
        This rule provides a modular, step-based approach to generating comprehensive Java project documentation
        including README.md files, package-info.java files, Javadoc, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
        Each step has a single responsibility and clear dependencies on user answers, making the documentation process more maintainable and user-friendly.
    </goal>

        <constraints-description>
            Before applying documentation generation, ensure the project is in a valid state by running Maven validation.
            This helps identify any existing issues that need to be resolved first.

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive README.md files based on project structure and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected README.md generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "README.md", "Both README.md and package-info.java files", or "All options: README.md, package-info.java &amp; Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

Use the following template and guidelines:

<xi:include href="fragments/java-documentation-implementation-template.md" parse="text"/>

## Single Module Project Implementation

**For single module projects:**

1. **Analyze the src/main/java directory** using codebase_search to understand:
   - Main application classes and entry points
   - Package structure and organization
   - Key business logic and functionality
   - Framework usage (Spring, etc.)
   - Dependencies and integrations

2. **Generate comprehensive README.md** in project root with:
   - **Software Description section**: Detailed analysis of the codebase functionality
   - **Getting Started section**: Build and run instructions
   - **Configuration section**: If config files detected
   - **API Documentation section**: If REST controllers found
   - **Additional sections**: Based on user preferences from Step 1

## Multi-Module Project Implementation

**For multi-module Maven projects:**

1. **Generate root README.md** with:
   - High-level project overview
   - Module descriptions and links
   - Common build instructions
   - Project-wide configuration

2. **Generate module-specific README.md files** for each module:
   - Module-specific software description
   - Module's role in the larger project
   - Module-specific build and usage instructions
   - Dependencies specific to that module

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing README.md completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Intelligently merge with existing content, adding missing sections
- **Create backup**: Save original as README.md.backup before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only generate README.md if it doesn't already exist

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Software Description must be comprehensive and accurate**
2. **Include practical examples and usage patterns** if user requested
3. **Follow chosen documentation style** (Professional/Developer-friendly/Minimal/Educational)
4. **Ensure all generated content is technically accurate**
5. **Include appropriate Maven commands and build instructions**

## Validation

After generating README.md files, verify they contain:
- Accurate software description based on code analysis
- Correct build and run instructions
- Proper formatting and structure
- No placeholder text or generic content

                <step-content><![CDATA[
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive package-info.java files for all packages based on code analysis and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected package-info.java generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "package-info.java files", "Both README.md and package-info.java files", or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify all packages** in src/main/java across all modules
2. **Analyze each package** to understand its purpose and contents
3. **Generate appropriate package-info.java** based on user's detail level preference
4. **Handle existing files** according to user's file handling strategy

## Package Analysis Process

**For each package found:**

1. **Scan package contents** using codebase_search:
   - Identify all classes in the package
   - Understand class responsibilities and relationships
   - Detect design patterns and architectural roles
   - Identify main public APIs and entry points

2. **Categorize package purpose**:
   - Application entry points
   - Business logic/domain models
   - Data access/repositories
   - Web controllers/REST APIs
   - Utilities/helpers
   - Configuration classes
   - External integrations

3. **Generate documentation level** based on user preference:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Brief description of package purpose]
 *
 * This package contains [main functionality description].
 * Key classes: [list main classes with brief descriptions]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Package name] - [Comprehensive description]
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * [Detailed explanation of what this package does and its role in the application]
 *
 * <h2>Main Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ClassName1} - [Description of purpose and key responsibilities]</li>
 * <li>{@link ClassName2} - [Description of purpose and key responsibilities]</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage pattern
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * [Description of key external dependencies this package uses]
 *
 * @since [version if available]
 * @author [author info if available from git or existing docs]
 */
package [package.name];
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief one-line description of package purpose and main functionality].
 */
package [package.name];
```

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing package-info.java completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Enhance existing package-info.java by adding missing documentation elements
- **Create backup**: Save original as package-info.java.backup before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only generate package-info.java if it doesn't already exist in the package

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Each package description must accurately reflect the package's actual purpose**
2. **Include references to main public classes using {@link} tags**
3. **Provide practical usage examples for detailed level**
4. **Use proper Javadoc formatting and tags**
5. **Ensure descriptions are written for software engineers to easily understand**

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Process packages in logical order** (e.g., main application packages first, then utilities)
2. **Use consistent documentation style** across all packages
3. **Ensure cross-references between related packages when appropriate**
4. **Include package relationships and dependencies in descriptions**
5. **Validate that all generated package-info.java files compile correctly**

## Validation

After generating package-info.java files:
- Verify proper Javadoc syntax
- Ensure all class references are valid
- Check that package declarations match directory structure
- Confirm documentation accurately describes package contents

**Purpose**: Enhance existing Javadoc comments and generate comprehensive Javadoc documentation for public APIs based on code analysis and user preferences.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected Javadoc enhancement in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "Javadoc enhancement" or "All options: README.md, package-info.java & Javadoc files" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify classes and methods** that need Javadoc enhancement
2. **Analyze existing documentation** to understand current state
3. **Generate comprehensive Javadoc** based on user's detail level preference
4. **Handle existing documentation** according to user's file handling strategy

## Javadoc Analysis Process

**For each Java file found:**

1. **Scan for missing or incomplete Javadoc**:
   - Public classes without class-level documentation
   - Public methods without method documentation
   - Parameters without @param tags
   - Return values without @return tags
   - Exceptions without @throws tags

2. **Analyze method signatures and implementations**:
   - Understand method purpose from implementation
   - Identify parameters and their roles
   - Determine return value meanings
   - Identify checked and unchecked exceptions

3. **Generate documentation level** based on user preference:

### Basic Level
```java
/**
 * [Brief description of class/method purpose].
 *
 * @param paramName [parameter description]
 * @return [return value description]
 * @throws ExceptionType [exception description]
 */
```

### Detailed Level
```java
/**
 * [Comprehensive description of class/method purpose and behavior].
 *
 * <p>[Additional context about usage patterns, side effects, or important considerations]
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example code showing typical usage
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param paramName [detailed parameter description with constraints and expectations]
 * @return [detailed return value description with possible values and meanings]
 * @throws ExceptionType [detailed exception description with conditions that trigger it]
 * @since [version if available]
 * @see [related classes or methods]
 */
```

### Minimal Level
```java
/**
 * [One-line description of purpose].
 * @param paramName [brief parameter description]
 * @return [brief return description]
 */
```

## File Handling Strategy

**Based on user selection in Step 1:**

- **Overwrite**: Replace existing Javadoc completely (after creating backup)
- **Add new information**: Enhance existing Javadoc by adding missing tags and descriptions
- **Create backup**: Save original files with .backup extension before modifying
- **Skip files**: Only add Javadoc where none exists

## Content Quality Requirements

1. **Each Javadoc comment must accurately describe the actual method/class behavior**
2. **Include all necessary @param, @return, and @throws tags**
3. **Provide practical usage examples for complex methods**
4. **Use proper Javadoc formatting and HTML tags**
5. **Ensure descriptions help other developers understand the API**

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Focus on public and protected APIs first**
2. **Use consistent documentation style across all classes**
3. **Include cross-references using {@link} tags when appropriate**
4. **Document preconditions, postconditions, and side effects**
5. **Validate that all generated Javadoc compiles and renders correctly**

## Validation

After enhancing Javadoc:
- Verify proper Javadoc syntax and HTML formatting
- Ensure all @param tags match actual parameters
- Check that @return tags are present for non-void methods
- Confirm @throws tags match declared exceptions
- Validate that Javadoc generation works: `./mvnw javadoc:javadoc`

                <step-content><![CDATA[
**Purpose**: Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) through an interactive conversational process that gathers all necessary information systematically.

**Dependencies**: Only execute if user selected ADR generation in Step 1. Requires completion of Step 1.

**CONDITIONAL EXECUTION**: Only execute this step if user selected "ADR (Architecture Decision Record) - interactive generation" in Step 1.

## Implementation Strategy

This step implements a conversational approach to create comprehensive ADRs by systematically gathering information through targeted questions, following the pattern from the referenced conversational assistant.

## Phase 0: Get Current Date

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting the ADR creation process, get the current date from the computer using the terminal command `date` to ensure accurate timestamps in the ADR document.

```bash
date
```

## Phase 1: Information Gathering

Acknowledge the request and inform the user that you need to ask some targeted questions to create a well-structured ADR. Then, systematically gather information through the conversational process outlined below.

**CRITICAL**: Ask questions ONE BY ONE in the exact order specified. WAIT for user response to each question before proceeding to the next.

### Initial Context Questions

1. **"What architectural decision or problem are we addressing today?"**
   - This helps establish the main topic and scope
   - Use the answer to create the ADR title

2. **"Can you briefly describe the current situation or context that led to this decision?"**
   - This fills the Context and Problem Statement section
   - Ask follow-up questions if the context isn't clear

### Stakeholder Information Questions

3. **"Who are the key decision-makers involved in this decision?"**
   - List names/roles for the decision-makers metadata field

4. **"Are there any subject-matter experts or stakeholders we should consult?"**
   - Fill the "consulted" metadata field
   - Distinguish between consulted (two-way communication) and informed (one-way)

5. **"Who else needs to be kept informed about this decision?"**
   - Fill the "informed" metadata field

### Decision Analysis Questions

6. **"What are the main factors driving this decision?"**
   - Examples: performance requirements, cost constraints, compliance needs, technical debt
   - This creates the Decision Drivers section

7. **"What options have you considered to solve this problem?"**
   - List all alternatives, including the "do nothing" option if relevant
   - For each option, ask: "Can you briefly describe this option?"

8. **"For each option, what are the main advantages and disadvantages?"**
   - This fills the Pros and Cons section
   - Ask specific follow-up questions about trade-offs

### Decision Outcome Questions

9. **"Which option have you chosen or do you recommend?"**
   - This becomes the chosen option in Decision Outcome

10. **"What's the main reasoning behind this choice?"**
    - Include criteria that ruled out other options
    - Mention any knockout factors

### Implementation and Consequences Questions

11. **"What positive outcomes do you expect from this decision?"**
    - Fill the "Good, because..." items in Consequences

12. **"What potential negative impacts or risks should we be aware of?"**
    - Fill the "Bad, because..." items in Consequences

13. **"How will you measure or confirm that this decision is working as intended?"**
    - This creates the Confirmation section
    - Ask about metrics, reviews, tests, or other validation methods

### Additional Information Questions

14. **"Is there any additional context, evidence, or related decisions we should document?"**
    - Fill the More Information section
    - Ask about related ADRs, external resources, or future considerations

15. **"What's the current status of this decision? (proposed/accepted/implemented/etc.)"**
    - Set the status metadata field

## Phase 2: ADR Document Generation

Once all information is gathered through conversation, inform the user you will now generate the ADR document. Use the current date obtained from the `date` command to replace the `{YYYY-MM-DD when the decision was last updated}` placeholders in the template.

**Template Usage**: Use the following ADR template structure:

```markdown
---
# These are optional metadata elements. Feel free to remove any of them.
status: "{proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | ‚Ä¶ | superseded by ADR-0123}"
date: {YYYY-MM-DD when the decision was last updated}
decision-makers: {list everyone involved in the decision}
consulted: {list everyone whose opinions are sought (typically subject-matter experts); and with whom there is a two-way communication}
informed: {list everyone who is kept up-to-date on progress; and with whom there is a one-way communication}
---

# {short title, representative of solved problem and found solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

## Decision Drivers

* {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, ‚Ä¶}
* {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, ‚Ä¶}
* ‚Ä¶ <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* {title of option 1}
* {title of option 2}
* {title of option 3}
* ‚Ä¶ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | ‚Ä¶ | comes out best (see below)}.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, ‚Ä¶}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, ‚Ä¶}
* ‚Ä¶ <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation / compliance of the ADR can/will be confirmed. Is there any automated or manual fitness function? If so, list it and explain how it is applied. Is the chosen design and its implementation in line with the decision? E.g., a design/code review or a test with a library such as ArchUnit can help validate this. Note that although we classify this element as optional, it is included in many ADRs.}

## More Information

{You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or document the team agreement on the decision and/or define when/how this decision the decision should be realized and if/when it should be re-visited. Links to other decisions and resources might appear here as well.}
```

## Phase 3: File Creation and Storage

1. **Determine ADR file location** based on user selection from Step 1:
   - Use the directory path selected by user in Question 10
   - Create directory if it doesn't exist

2. **Generate ADR filename**:
   - Format: `ADR-{number}-{short-title-kebab-case}.md`
   - Auto-increment number based on existing ADR files in the directory
   - Convert title to kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)

3. **Create the ADR file** with complete content using the template structure

4. **Validate the generated ADR**:
   - Ensure all sections are properly filled
   - Verify markdown formatting is correct
   - Check that all placeholders are replaced with actual content

## Conversation Guidelines

- **Ask one question at a time** to avoid overwhelming the user
- **Follow up with clarifying questions** when answers are vague or incomplete
- **Summarize key points** periodically to confirm understanding
- **Be flexible with the order** - if information comes up naturally, capture it even if it's out of sequence
- **Suggest examples** when users seem stuck on a question
- **Validate completeness** before generating the final document

## Example Follow-up Questions

- "Can you elaborate on that point?"
- "What specific concerns led to this requirement?"
- "How does this compare to your current approach?"
- "What would happen if we don't make this decision?"
- "Are there any constraints or limitations we haven't discussed?"
- "Who would be most affected by this change?"

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing the ADR, ensure:
- [ ] The title clearly represents both the problem and solution
- [ ] The context explains why this decision is needed
- [ ] All considered options are documented with pros/cons
- [ ] The chosen solution is clearly justified
- [ ] Consequences (both positive and negative) are realistic
- [ ] Confirmation methods are specific and measurable
- [ ] All stakeholders are properly categorized
- [ ] Current date is properly formatted and inserted
- [ ] All template placeholders are replaced with actual content

## Next Steps and Recommendations

After generating the ADR document, provide these additional recommendations:

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and validate the ADR with all stakeholders and technical teams
2. Distribute the ADR to all relevant parties for awareness and feedback
3. Implement the architectural decision according to the documented approach
4. Set up monitoring and validation mechanisms as defined in the Confirmation section
5. Schedule regular reviews to assess the decision's effectiveness

**Tips for ADR Management:**
- Keep the ADR living document - update it as decisions evolve or new information emerges
- Ensure all team members understand the decisions and their rationale
- Reference the ADR during architectural discussions and design reviews
- Plan regular reviews to assess if decisions are still valid as the system evolves
- Link the ADR to related user stories, technical requirements, and implementation tasks

**Purpose**: Validate all generated documentation and provide a comprehensive summary of changes made.

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of applicable steps (2, 3, 4, and/or 6 based on user selections).

## Validation Process

1. **Compile Validation**:
```bash
# Validate that all package-info.java files compile correctly
./mvnw clean compile
```

2. **Javadoc Validation**:
```bash
# Validate that all Javadoc generates correctly
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
```

3. **Content Validation**:
- Verify README.md files have proper markdown formatting
- Ensure all links and references are valid
- Check that software descriptions accurately reflect the codebase
- Validate that Javadoc in package-info.java files is syntactically correct
- Verify ADR files have proper markdown formatting and complete content

4. **Consistency Validation**:
- Ensure consistent documentation style across all generated files
- Verify that cross-references between files are accurate
- Check that naming conventions are followed
