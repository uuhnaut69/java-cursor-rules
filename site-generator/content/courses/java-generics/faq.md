## üìö Course Content

### Q: What Java version do I need for this course?
**A**: The course is designed for Java 17+ (LTS), but most concepts work from Java 8+. Modern features like Records and sealed types require Java 14+ and Java 17+ respectively.

### Q: How long does it take to complete the course?
**A**: The full course is designed for 12-15 hours:
- **Quick Start**: 2 hours (essentials only)
- **Comprehensive**: 12-15 hours (full depth)
- **Expert Track**: 6 hours (advanced patterns only)
- **Team Workshop**: 4 hours (collaborative format)

### Q: Do I need prior experience with generics?
**A**: No! The course starts from fundamentals. However, you should be comfortable with:
- Java basics (classes, interfaces, inheritance)
- Collections framework (List, Set, Map)
- Basic object-oriented programming

### Q: Can I take modules out of order?
**A**: We recommend following the sequence, as each module builds on previous concepts:
1. **Foundations** ‚Üí 2. **Wildcards & PECS** ‚Üí 3. **Advanced Patterns** ‚Üí 4. **Real-World** ‚Üí 5. **Assessment**

However, experienced developers might skip to Module 2 or 3 if comfortable with basics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup

### Q: What development environment do I need?
**A**: Any modern Java IDE works:
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended for best generics support)
- **Eclipse** (with recent versions)
- **VS Code** with Java Extension Pack
- **NetBeans** 12+

### Q: Do I need Maven/Gradle experience?
**A**: Basic familiarity helps, but we provide all build configurations. You mainly need to run:
```bash
./mvnw compile  # Compile code
./mvnw test     # Run tests
```

### Q: Can I use the course materials offline?
**A**: Yes! All course materials are available as markdown files in the repository. Clone the repo for offline access.

3. Don't skip the hands-on coding challenges
4. Join the discussion forum for help

### Q: I know basic generics - can I skip ahead?
**A**: Take the **Expert Track** (6 hours):
1. Quick review of [Module 1](../module-1-foundations/) (30 min)
2. Focus on [Module 2: Wildcards & PECS](../module-2-wildcards/) (2 hours)
3. Deep dive into [Module 3: Advanced Patterns](../module-3-advanced/) (2 hours)
4. Complete [Module 4: Real-World Applications](../module-4-realworld/) (1.5 hours)

### Q: My team needs training - what's the best approach?
**A**: Use the **Team Workshop** format:
- 4-hour interactive session
- Mix of theory and pair programming
- Code review exercises
- Group problem-solving
- Customizable for your domain

## üéØ Exercises & Challenges

### Q: Are the coding exercises mandatory?
**A**: Highly recommended! The exercises are designed to:
- Reinforce theoretical concepts
- Provide hands-on experience
- Build muscle memory for generic patterns
- Prepare you for real-world scenarios

### Q: I'm stuck on an exercise - where can I get help?
**A**: Multiple support options:
1. **Check the solution**: Each exercise has detailed solutions
2. **Discussion Forum**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jabrena/java-cursor-rules/discussions)
3. **Stack Overflow**: Tag questions with `java-generics-course`
4. **Office Hours**: Weekly Q&A sessions (check schedule)

### Q: Can I submit my own solutions for review?
**A**: Absolutely! Create a pull request or post in discussions. We love seeing different approaches and learning from each other.

## üèÜ Certification

### Q: How do I get certified?
**A**: Complete [Module 5: Assessment & Certification](../module-5-assessment/):
1. **Coding Challenges**: Complete all comprehensive challenges
2. **Code Review**: Demonstrate ability to identify and fix issues
3. **Final Exam**: Pass with 70+ points
4. **Portfolio Project**: Submit one capstone project

### Q: What does certification include?
**A**: Your certification package includes:
- **Digital Certificate** (PDF and LinkedIn badge)
- **GitHub Badge** for your profile
- **Recommendation Template** for LinkedIn/resume
- **Continued Learning Roadmap**

### Q: How long is certification valid?
**A**: Lifetime! However, we recommend staying current with:
- Annual refresher courses
- New Java version updates
- Advanced topics as they emerge

### Q: Can I retake the certification exam?
**A**: Yes! You can retake after 30 days. Use the feedback to focus your study.

## üîß Common Issues

### Q: My code compiles but I get ClassCastException at runtime
**A**: This typically indicates:
- Using raw types instead of parameterized types
- Unsafe casting operations
- Type erasure issues

**Solution**: Review [Module 1: Type Safety](../module-1-foundations/#-the-problem-why-do-we-need-generics) and ensure you're using proper generic types.

### Q: I'm confused about when to use `extends` vs `super`
**A**: Remember **PECS**:
- **Producer Extends**: Use `? extends T` when you're **reading** from the collection
- **Consumer Super**: Use `? super T` when you're **writing** to the collection

**Deep dive**: [Module 2: PECS Principle](../module-2-wildcards/#-the-pecs-principle)

### Q: Generic arrays give me compilation errors
**A**: Arrays and generics don't mix well due to type erasure. Solutions:
- Use `List<T>` instead of `T[]`
- Use `Array.newInstance()` with `Class<T>` parameter
- Apply `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` carefully

**Details**: [Module 3: Type Erasure](../module-3-advanced/#-understanding-type-erasure)

### Q: What's the difference between `List<?>` and `List<Object>`?
**A**:
- `List<?>`: Unknown type, read-only (can't add anything except null)
- `List<Object>`: Specifically Object type, can add any Object

**Example**:
```java
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("hello");
List<?> wildcards = strings;        // ‚úÖ OK
List<Object> objects = strings;     // ‚ùå Compilation error
```

## üöÄ Advanced Topics

### Q: Should I learn functional programming with generics?
**A**: Yes! Modern Java heavily uses generics with:
- `Stream<T>` operations
- `Optional<T>` handling
- `CompletableFuture<T>` async programming
- Functional interfaces like `Function<T,R>`

### Q: How do generics work with Spring Framework?
**A**: Spring extensively uses generics for:
- Dependency injection: `@Autowired List<MyService>`
- REST controllers: `ResponseEntity<MyData>`
- Data repositories: `JpaRepository<Entity, ID>`
- Configuration: `@ConfigurationProperties`

### Q: What about generics in microservices?
**A**: Critical for:
- API design: `ApiResponse<T>` patterns
- Event handling: `Event<PayloadType>`
- Message queues: Type-safe message processing
- Client libraries: Generic HTTP clients

### Q: Performance considerations with generics?
**A**: Key points:
- Generics have **zero runtime overhead** (type erasure)
- Avoid excessive wildcards in hot paths
- Use primitive specializations when available
- Consider memory usage with nested generics
