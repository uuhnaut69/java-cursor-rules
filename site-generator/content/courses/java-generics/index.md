## Course Overview

Transform your Java development skills with this comprehensive course on generics - one of Java's most powerful yet misunderstood features. This course takes you from basic type safety concepts to advanced patterns used in production systems.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Eliminate ClassCastException** through proper generic type usage
- **Design flexible APIs** using PECS (Producer Extends Consumer Super) principle
- **Implement type-safe collections** without raw types or unsafe casts
- **Handle complex inheritance scenarios** with bounded type parameters
- **Integrate generics with modern Java features** like Records and sealed types
- **Apply advanced patterns** like type tokens and heterogeneous containers
- **Optimize performance** through proper generic design choices

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Java Fundamentals**: Classes, interfaces, inheritance, and collections
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding of polymorphism and encapsulation
- **Basic Maven/Gradle**: Ability to compile and run Java projects
- **Development Environment**: Java 17+ with IDE support

### ⏱️ Course Duration & Difficulty

- **Total Time**: 12-15 hours
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Format**: Self-paced with hands-on exercises
- **Certification**: Available upon completion
