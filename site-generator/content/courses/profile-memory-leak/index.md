## üõ†Ô∏è System Prompts Integration

This course demonstrates practical usage of three key system prompts:

### **[@161-java-profiling-detect](https://github.com/jabrena/cursor-rules-java/tree/main/.cursor/rules/161-java-profiling-detect.md)**
**Purpose:** Data collection and problem identification
**Usage:** My Java application has performance issues - help me set up comprehensive profiling process using @161-java-profiling-detect and use the location examples/spring-boot-memory-leak-demo/profiler

### **[@162-java-profiling-analyze](https://github.com/jabrena/cursor-rules-java/tree/main/.cursor/rules/162-java-profiling-analyze.md)**
**Purpose:** Systematic analysis and solution development
**Usage:** Analyze the results located in examples/spring-boot-memory-leak-demo/profiler and use the cursor rule @162-java-profiling-analyze

## üîç Interactive Elements Throughout the Course

### **üß† Knowledge Checks**
- "Before we continue, can you explain why GC retention grows with active memory leaks?"
- "What would happen if we didn't implement @PreDestroy in our thread pools?"
- "How do you interpret a flamegraph where the canvas height keeps growing?"

### **üí° Learning Reinforcement**
- "Notice how the NoCocoController eliminates the memory leak - that's the power of proper resource lifecycle management!"
- "This connects to our earlier lesson on bounded collections - remember the MAX_OBJECTS pattern?"
- "The 318% memory retention increase we observed demonstrates why systematic profiling is critical!"

### **üéØ Practical Challenges**
- Implement custom bounded collections with error handling
- Design monitoring strategies for production memory leak detection
- Create custom profiling configurations for specific scenarios
