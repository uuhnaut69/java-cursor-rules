## The Developer's Opportunity: Mastering Enterprise Patterns with AI

Baseline today: new services often start with copy‑pasted `pom.xml`, ad‑hoc testing, inconsistent security, and missing documentation. Outcome: uneven quality and avoidable rework. A better path is repeatable automation that encodes enterprise patterns while teaching the reasoning behind each choice.

This course shows how AI‑powered system prompts turn setup, testing, security, performance, and documentation into guided, standardized workflows. The result is faster delivery, higher quality, and a team that learns while shipping.

## Course Architecture: A Systematic Approach to Java Mastery

### The Seven-Module Progressive Journey

The course is meticulously structured as a **34-hour progressive learning experience** that builds expertise systematically:

#### Module 1: Foundations - Project Setup & Build Systems (4 hours)
**The Foundation of Excellence**

Every great application starts with solid foundations. This module transforms the tedious process of Maven project setup into an automated, best-practice-driven workflow.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- **Automated Maven Configuration**: Using `@110-java-maven-best-practices` to eliminate manual configuration errors
- **Quality Dependencies Integration**: Leveraging `@111-java-maven-dependencies` for JSpecify, Error Prone, NullAway, and VAVR
- **Essential Plugin Management**: Applying `@112-java-maven-plugins` for comprehensive build lifecycle management
- **Professional Documentation**: Generating developer-focused documentation with `@113-java-maven-documentation`

**Real-World Impact:**
```bash
# Before: Hours of manual Maven configuration
# After: Automated, consistent setup in minutes
Apply in the pom.xml the rule @110-java-maven-best-practices
```

The module demonstrates both **interactive** and **purist** approaches:
- **Interactive**: `Apply in the pom.xml the rule @110-java-maven-best-practices with the behaviour @behaviour-consultative-interaction`
- **Purist**: `Add VAVR dependency with the help of @111-java-maven-dependencies and don't ask any questions`

#### Module 2: Code Quality - Testing & Design Principles (5 hours)
**Building Robust, Maintainable Systems**

This module addresses the critical gap between knowing design principles and applying them systematically in real codebases.

**Advanced Testing Strategies:**
Using `@131-java-unit-testing`, developers learn to generate comprehensive test suites that follow the **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert) with proper mocking, parameterized tests, and exception handling.

**Object-Oriented Design Excellence:**
The `@121-java-object-oriented-design` prompt transforms monolithic, tightly-coupled code into well-structured, SOLID-compliant architectures:

```java
// Before: Monolithic service violating SRP
public class UserService {
    public void processUser(String userData) {
        // Parsing, validation, persistence, notification - all mixed together
    }
}

// After: Properly separated concerns
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repository;
    private final EmailService emailService;

    public void processUser(String userData) {
        User user = parseUser(userData);
        repository.save(user);
        emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.getEmail());
    }
}
```

**Type-Safe Design Patterns:**
The `@122-java-type-design` prompt eliminates primitive obsession and creates domain models where **illegal states are unrepresentable**:

```java
// Type-safe domain model using records
public record CustomerId(String value) {
    public CustomerId {
        if (value == null || value.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Customer ID cannot be empty");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Module 3: Secure Coding - Security & Best Practices (4 hours)
**Production-Ready Security and Concurrency**
Security and concurrency are often afterthoughts in Java education. This module makes them first-class concerns through systematic application of industry standards.

**OWASP-Compliant Security:**
The `@124-java-secure-coding` prompt transforms vulnerable code into secure implementations:

```java
// Before: SQL injection vulnerability
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";

// After: Parameterized queries with comprehensive security
Optional<User> userOpt = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
if (userOpt.isEmpty()) {
    logger.info("Authentication failed: user not found");
    return AuthResult.AUTHENTICATION_FAILED;
}
```

**Modern Concurrency Patterns:**
Using `@125-java-concurrency`, developers learn to apply **atomic operations**, **concurrent collections**, and **CompletableFuture** for thread-safe, performant applications.

#### Module 4: Modern Java - Advanced Language Features (6 hours)
**Leveraging Java's Evolution**

This module covers the most challenging aspects of modern Java, transforming complex concepts into practical, applicable skills.

**Generics Mastery:**
The `@128-java-generics` prompt addresses one of Java's most difficult topics, covering **PECS principles**, **type erasure**, and **bounded type parameters**:

```java
// Advanced generic builder with type safety
public static class Builder<T> {
    public Builder<T> addAll(Collection<? extends T> items) {
        this.items.addAll(items);
        return this;
    }
}
```

**Functional Programming Excellence:**
Through `@142-java-functional-programming`, imperative code transforms into declarative, composable solutions:

```java
// Functional transformation pipeline
return orders.stream()
    .filter(IS_COMPLETED)
    .filter(IS_HIGH_VALUE)
    .map(TO_SUMMARY)
    .sorted(BY_TOTAL_DESC)
    .collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());
```

**Monadic Error Handling:**
The `@143-java-functional-exception-handling` prompt introduces **Railway-Oriented Programming** with Either types, eliminating null pointer exceptions through design.

#### Module 5: Performance - Optimization & Profiling (8 hours)
**Systematic Performance Excellence**

Performance optimization becomes scientific and repeatable through comprehensive profiling and benchmarking workflows.

**JMeter Integration:**
Using `@151-java-performance-jmeter`, developers create realistic load testing scenarios that identify bottlenecks before production deployment.

**Professional Profiling:**
The profiling workflow spans three specialized prompts:
- `@161-java-profiling-detect`: Setup comprehensive profiling infrastructure
- `@162-java-profiling-analyze`: Systematic bottleneck identification
- `@164-java-profiling-compare`: Scientific validation of improvements

**Micro-Benchmarking:**
JMH integration enables data-driven optimization decisions:

```java
@Benchmark
public String concatenationWithStreams() {
    return strings.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.joining(""));
}
```

#### Module 6: Documentation - Professional Documentation & Diagrams (3 hours)
**Automated Documentation Excellence**

Documentation transforms from a manual chore into an automated, comprehensive process.

**Multi-Level Documentation:**
The `@170-java-documentation` prompt generates:
- **README.md**: User-focused project overview
- **README-DEV.md**: Developer-focused technical documentation
- **package-info.java**: Package-level API documentation

### Case Study: Memory Leak Resolution

The course demonstrates practical problem-solving through real scenarios. In Module 5, students learn to diagnose a production memory leak:

**The Problem**: Spring Boot microservice experiencing gradual memory growth leading to OutOfMemoryErrors.

**The AI-Powered Investigation**:
```bash
# Comprehensive memory leak detection
jcmd 12345 JFR.start name=memory-leak-investigation duration=1800s \
  "jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB#enabled=true,stackTrace=true" \
  "jdk.OldObjectSample#enabled=true,cutoff=0ms" \
  filename=memory-leak-30min.jfr
```
