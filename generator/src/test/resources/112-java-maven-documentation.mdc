- **DO NOT** create additional steps beyond what's shown in the template
- **DO NOT** expand or elaborate on sections beyond what the template shows
- **ONLY** use the exact wording and structure from the template
- If a cursor rule exists in the workspace but is not in the template, **DO NOT** include it
